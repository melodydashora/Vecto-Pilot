# Event Proximity & Staging Nodes Integration Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED - Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

This integration adds two major capabilities to Vecto Pilot:

1. **Event Proximity Matching** - Associate events to venues by geographic proximity (not just place_id)
2. **Staging Nodes** - Support for mall entrances, drop-off zones, and curb resources with parent complex hour inheritance

Both features maintain the **runtime-fresh, coordinate-first, no hardcoded locations** specification.

---

## 🎯 What's New

### Event Proximity Association

**Problem Solved:** Events at "Legacy West" or "Stonebriar Centre" now boost nearby venues even when exact place_id match fails.

**How It Works:**
- Perplexity returns event coordinates + timing
- System computes distance from event to ALL candidates (runtime haversine)
- If within `EVENT_ASSOC_RADIUS_M` (default 350m), attach "nearby" ribbon
- Rank boost scales with proximity + impact + imminence

**Example:**
```
🎃 Hall-O-Ween nearby · ~250m SE · 7-10 PM
Reason: within 350m of Box Garden; high-impact egress expected
```

### Staging Nodes (Entrances/Curb Access)

**Problem Solved:** "Stonebriar Centre (SE entrance by Dillard's)" no longer shows "Closed" due to name mismatch.

**How It Works:**
- Geometry-first deduplication prevents name-based false closures
- Entrance/drop-off/curb nodes classified as `node_type='staging'`
- Access status inherited from parent complex (mall/venue)
- Rank boost when serving many open venues or nearby events

**UI Display:**
```
STAGING • High priority
Access: Available (mall open 10 AM - 9 PM)
Serves 8 open venues within 250m
```

## 📦 Database Migrations

### Migration 0004: Event Proximity
**File:** `drizzle/0004_event_proximity.sql`

**Additions to `events_facts`:**
- `coordinates_source` - Where coords came from (perplexity, geocoder, runtime, manual)
- `location_quality` - exact (place_id match) or approx (proximity/district)
- `radius_hint_m` - Approximate crowd footprint radius
- `impact_hint` - Rideshare demand impact (none, low, med, high)

**New Functions:**
- `fn_haversine_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)` - Distance in meters
- Updated `fn_refresh_venue_enrichment()` - Now includes proximity matching
- Updated `fn_upsert_event()` - Supports new proximity fields

**Enrichment Logic:**
```sql
-- Exact match OR proximity within radius
WHERE (
  e.venue_place_id = rc.place_id
  OR
  fn_haversine_distance(e.coords, rc.coords) <= 350
)
```

### Migration 0005: Staging Nodes
**File:** `drizzle/0005_staging_nodes.sql`

**Additions to `ranking_candidates`:**
- `node_type` - venue or staging
- `access_status` - available, restricted, unknown (for staging)
- `access_notes` - Human-readable access policy
- `aliases` - Name variants for deduplication
- `geom_key` - Geometry hash (~50m grid) for coords-first dedupe
- `canonical_name` - Normalized name from catalog/runtime
- `display_suffix` - UI-only descriptor (e.g., "SE entrance")

**New Functions:**
- `fn_detect_staging_node(name, category)` - Heuristic detection
- `fn_generate_geom_key(lat, lng)` - Geometry bucketing
- `fn_find_parent_complex_name(name)` - Extract parent venue

**Auto-Reclassification:**
- Existing entrance/drop-off rows marked as staging
- Geometry keys populated for all candidates

## 🔧 Backend Integration

### Event Proximity Boost Scoring
**File:** `server/lib/event-proximity-boost.js`

**Functions:**
```javascript
// Calculate event boost for ranking
eventProximityBoost(event, distanceMeters)
// Returns: 0-1+ score based on impact, imminence, proximity

// Calculate staging priority
stagingPriority(candidate, nearbyVenuesOpenCount, nearbyEventsHighCount)
// Returns: 0-1+ score based on serve capacity, events, access

// Count open venues within radius
countOpenVenuesWithinRadius(anchorCoord, candidates, radiusMeters)

// Count high-impact events nearby
countHighImpactEventsNearby(anchorCoord, candidates, radiusMeters)
```

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Event Boost = W_EVENT × (
  0.6 × impact_score +
  0.3 × imminence_decay +
  0.1 × badge_bonus
) × confidence × proximity_factor

Staging Priority = W_STAGING × (
  0.6 × serve_score +  // tanh(open_venues/6)
  0.3 × events_score +
  0.1 × access_factor
)
```

### Perplexity Event Research
**File:** `server/lib/perplexity-event-prompt.js`

**Prompt Template:**
```javascript
generateEventResearchPrompt({
  venueOrDistrictName: "Legacy West",
  date: "2025-10-30",
  windowStartIso: "2025-10-30T18:00:00-05:00",
  windowEndIso: "2025-10-30T22:00:00-05:00",
  city: "Frisco",
  state: "Texas"
})
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Halloween Event",
    "start_time_iso": "2025-10-30T19:00:00-05:00",
    "end_time_iso": "2025-10-30T22:00:00-05:00",
    "venue_name": "Legacy West - Box Garden",
    "coordinates": {"lat": 33.0698, "lng": -96.8347},
    "radius_hint_m": 200,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "source_urls": ["https://example.com/event"],
    "impact_hint": "high",
    "notes": "Expect surge pricing 7-10 PM"
  }
]
```

## 🧪 Testing Event Proximity

### Step 1: Seed Event with Coordinates
```bash
# Use runtime coordinates from a real venue
VENUE_PLACE_ID="ChIJN8pGFPp3TIYRT1o85KdCqQA" \
VENUE_NAME="Legacy West" \
COORDINATES_LAT="33.0698" \
COORDINATES_LNG="-96.8347" \
COORDINATES_SOURCE="perplexity" \
LOCATION_QUALITY="approx" \
RADIUS_HINT_M="300" \
IMPACT_HINT="high" \
EVENT_TITLE="Legacy West Halloween Night" \
EVENT_TYPE="festival" \
START_ISO="2025-10-31T19:00:00-05:00" \
END_ISO="2025-10-31T23:00:00-05:00" \
CONFIDENCE="0.95" \
node scripts/seed-event.mjs
```

### Step 2: Refresh Enrichment
```bash
SNAPSHOT_ID=$(node scripts/latest-snapshot.mjs)
SNAPSHOT_ID=$SNAPSHOT_ID node scripts/refresh-enrichment.mjs
```

### Step 3: Verify Proximity Matching
```sql
-- Check which candidates got nearby events
SELECT 
  name,
  place_id,
  venue_events->>'badge' as badge,
  (venue_events->>'nearby')::bool as is_nearby,
  (venue_events->>'offset_m')::int as distance_meters,
  venue_events->>'location_quality' as quality
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE snapshot_id = '<your_snapshot_id>'
  AND venue_events IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY (venue_events->>'offset_m')::int NULLS FIRST;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Venues within 350m get event badge with `nearby=true`
- `offset_m` shows distance in meters
- Exact match has `offset_m=0`, `nearby=false`
- Proximity matches have `offset_m>0`, `nearby=true`

---

## 🧪 Testing Staging Nodes

### Step 1: Check Auto-Reclassification
```sql
-- See which candidates are now staging nodes
SELECT 
  name,
  node_type,
  access_status,
  canonical_name,
  display_suffix,
  geom_key
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE node_type = 'staging'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 2: Test Geometry Deduplication
```sql
-- Check candidates at same location
SELECT 
  geom_key,
  array_agg(name) as name_variants,
  COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE geom_key IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY geom_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

### Step 3: Verify Parent Complex Inference
```sql
-- Test parent complex extraction
SELECT 
  name,
  fn_find_parent_complex_name(name) as parent_name
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE node_type = 'staging'
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Event Badge with Nearby Indicator
```tsx
const EventBadge = ({ candidate }) => {
  const events = candidate.venue_events;
  
  if (!events?.badge) {
    return candidate.event_badge_missing ? (
      <span className="badge badge--neutral">⚪ No current events</span>
    ) : null;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="event-badge">
      <span className="badge badge--event">
        {events.badge}
        {events.nearby && <span className="nearby-indicator">≈</span>}
      </span>
      <div className="tooltip">
        <p>{events.summary}</p>
        {events.nearby && (
          <p className="proximity-note">
            Nearby event (~{events.offset_m}m)
            {events.location_quality === 'approx' && ' • Location approximate'}
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Staging Node Display
```tsx
const StagingIndicator = ({ candidate }) => {
  if (candidate.node_type !== 'staging') return null;
  
  const statusMap = {
    available: { icon: '✓', color: 'green', text: 'Available' },
    restricted: { icon: '⚠', color: 'amber', text: 'Restricted' },
    unknown: { icon: '?', color: 'gray', text: 'Check locally' }
  };
  
  const status = statusMap[candidate.access_status] || statusMap.unknown;
  
  return (
    <div className="staging-indicator">
      <span className="badge badge--staging">STAGING • High priority</span>
      <div className="access-status" style={{ color: status.color }}>
        {status.icon} {status.text}
      </div>
      {candidate.access_notes && (
        <p className="access-notes">{candidate.access_notes}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🔍 SQL Verification Queries

### Event Proximity Coverage
```sql
-- How many candidates have events (exact vs nearby)?
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE venue_events IS NOT NULL AND (venue_events->>'nearby')::bool = false) as exact_match,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE venue_events IS NOT NULL AND (venue_events->>'nearby')::bool = true) as proximity_match,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event_badge_missing = true) as no_events,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE venue_events IS NULL AND event_badge_missing = false) as not_enriched
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE snapshot_id = (SELECT snapshot_id FROM snapshots ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1);
```

### Staging Node Distribution
```sql
-- Breakdown of node types
SELECT 
  node_type,
  access_status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM ranking_candidates
WHERE snapshot_id = (SELECT snapshot_id FROM snapshots ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY node_type, access_status
ORDER BY node_type, access_status;
```

### Event Impact Analysis
```sql
-- Events by impact level
SELECT 
  impact_hint,
  location_quality,
  COUNT(*) as event_count,
  AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM events_facts
WHERE expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > now()
GROUP BY impact_hint, location_quality
ORDER BY impact_hint;
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Event Proximity Matching
| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Event at exact venue (place_id match) | `nearby=false`, `offset_m=0`, full boost |
| Event within 350m | `nearby=true`, `offset_m=<distance>`, scaled boost |
| Event beyond 350m | Not attached, no boost |
| Event with approx coords | `location_quality='approx'`, UI shows ≈ indicator |

### Staging Node Classification
| Pattern | Classification | Access Status |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| "SE entrance by Dillard's" | staging | Inherit from mall |
| "Drop-off zone" | staging | unknown (check policy) |
| "Stonebriar Centre (entrance)" | staging | Inherit from Stonebriar |
| "Walmart Supercenter" | venue | From business hours |
