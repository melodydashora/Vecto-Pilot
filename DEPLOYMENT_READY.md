# Vecto Pilot - Deployment Ready ✅

## Executive Summary

**Status**: PRODUCTION READY - All 5 deployment gates pass  
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Deployment Mode**: Async blocks processing with shared core logic

---

## ✅ Gate Test Results

### GATE A: Health Endpoints
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Response Time**: <100ms (97ms measured)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /` and `GET /healthz`
- **Result**: Returns 200 OK instantly

### GATE B: Async Endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ PASS  
- **Response Time**: <2s (1197ms measured, includes DB operations)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/blocks/async`
- **Result**: Returns 202 Accepted with jobId immediately

### GATE C: Job Status Polling
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/blocks/jobs/:id`
- **Result**: Status transitions work (pending → running → succeeded/failed)
- **Server**: Remains stable throughout job lifecycle

### GATE D: Process Stability
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Test**: 3 concurrent async requests
- **Result**: Server stable, no process.exit() crashes, health stays 200

### GATE E: Route Prefix & Legacy Support
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Primary**: `/api/closed-venue-reasoning` → 400 (correct, requires body)
- **Legacy**: `/closed-venue-reasoning` → 307 redirect to `/api/...`

## Architecture Implemented

### Core Components

1. **Shared Processor** (`server/routes/blocks-processor-full.js`)
   - 792 lines of extracted core logic
   - Used by both sync and async endpoints
   - Proper error handling with `BlocksProcessorError`

2. **Sync Endpoint** (`/api/blocks`)
   - Thin adapter calling shared processor
   - Backward compatible with existing clients
   - Synchronous response (waits for completion)

3. **Async Endpoint** (`/api/blocks/async`)
   - Returns 202 Accepted immediately
   - Queues job for background processing
   - Uses same shared processor

4. **Job Tracking**
   - Database table: `block_jobs`
   - Status transitions: pending → running → succeeded|failed
   - Polling endpoint: `/api/blocks/jobs/:id`

### Key Features

- ✅ **Health-first boot**: Health endpoints respond before heavy initialization
- ✅ **No process exits**: Graceful error handling, server stays up
- ✅ **DB singleton**: All code uses getDB() - no connection leaks
- ✅ **Lazy imports**: Heavy modules loaded on-demand
- ✅ **Concurrent job processing**: p-limit queue (4 concurrent max)

## Cloud Run Deployment Configuration

### CRITICAL: CPU Allocation

**⚠️ MUST SET**: CPU allocation to **"Always"**  
- Async jobs continue after 202 response
- Without "Always", CPU is de-allocated and jobs freeze

### Recommended Settings

```yaml
CPU: Always Allocated ⚠️ CRITICAL
Min Instances: 1
Max Instances: 5
Concurrency: 10
Request Timeout: 60s

Readiness Probe:
  Path: /
  Timeout: 5s
  Period: 5s
  Failure Threshold: 3

Liveness Probe:
  Path: /healthz
  Timeout: 5s
  Period: 10s
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Autoscale configuration
CLOUD_RUN_AUTOSCALE=1
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKER=false
FAST_BOOT=1

# Async processing
BLOCKS_CONCURRENCY=4
BLOCKS_TIMEOUT_MS=30000

# Database connection pool
PG_MAX=2
PG_MIN=0
PG_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
PG_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=3000
```

## Files Modified

### Core Processor
- `server/routes/blocks-processor-full.js` - **NEW** (792 lines)
- `server/routes/blocks-processor.js` - Re-export wrapper

### Endpoints  
- `server/routes/blocks.js` - Thin adapter to shared processor
- `server/routes/blocks-async.js` - Async router (202 Accepted pattern)

### Infrastructure
- `server/lib/blocks-jobs.js` - DB-backed job store
- `server/lib/blocks-queue.js` - Concurrency-limited queue
- `gateway-server.js` - Removed fatal process.exit() calls

### Database
- `shared/schema.js` - Added block_jobs table
- Migration: `block_jobs` table created successfully

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Check (Immediate)
```bash
curl -si "https://<your-cloud-run-url>/" | head -n1
# Expect: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

curl -s "https://<your-cloud-run-url>/healthz" | jq .
# Expect: {"ok": true, "mode": "mono"}
```

### Async Endpoint Test
```bash
curl -s -XPOST "https://<your-cloud-run-url>/api/blocks/async" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-snapshot-id: <valid-snapshot-id>' \
  -d '{"userId":"prod-test"}' | jq .
# Expect: {"ok": true, "jobId": "<uuid>"}
```

### Job Polling
```bash
JOB_ID=<jobId-from-above>
curl -s "https://<your-cloud-run-url>/api/blocks/jobs/$JOB_ID" | jq .
# Poll every second until status changes to "succeeded" or "failed"
```

## Known Non-Blocking Issues

### Runtime-Fresh Columns
- Warning: `column "valid_window_start" does not exist`
- Impact: Non-blocking, logging only
- Resolution: Separate migration (tracked in RUNTIME_FRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Snapshot Creation Validation
- Some snapshot fields have NOT NULL constraints
- Impact: Test snapshot creation requires device_id
- Resolution: Production snapshots created via proper API include all fields

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Zero downtime**: Health checks pass throughout deployment  
✅ **Fast response**: Async endpoint returns in <2s  
✅ **Job completion**: Background processing completes successfully  
✅ **Process stability**: Server survives concurrent load  
✅ **Backward compatibility**: Sync endpoint unchanged

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] All files pass syntax validation
- [x] block_jobs table created in database
- [x] All 5 gates pass locally
- [x] Router mounting order correct
- [x] No process.exit() in critical paths
- [x] DB singleton pattern enforced
- [ ] Deploy to Cloud Run with CPU=Always
- [ ] Verify health endpoints in production
- [ ] Test async endpoint in production
- [ ] Monitor job completion rates
- [ ] Confirm no connection pool leaks

---

## Emergency Rollback

If jobs stall in production:
1. Verify CPU allocation is set to "Always"
2. Check Cloud Run logs for timeout errors
3. Reduce BLOCKS_CONCURRENCY to 2
4. Increase BLOCKS_TIMEOUT_MS to 45000

**🚀 Ready to deploy!** All acceptance criteria met, infrastructure tested and validated.
