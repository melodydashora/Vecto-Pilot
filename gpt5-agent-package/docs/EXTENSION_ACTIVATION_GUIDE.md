# 🧩 GPT-5 Replit Agent - Activation Guide

## ✅ Build Status
```
✅ TypeScript compiled successfully
✅ All artifacts generated in dist/
✅ extension.json configured correctly
✅ OPENAI_API_KEY secret ready
```

## 🎯 How to Activate (Browser-Based Extension)

### Important: Why Node.js Failed
The error you saw:
```
Error: Extension must be initialized in a browser context
```

This is **expected behavior**. Replit Extensions run **in the browser** (inside an iframe), not as standalone Node.js servers. You cannot run them with `node dist/index.js` or `ts-node`.

### ✅ Correct Activation Method

#### Step 1: Build the Extension
```bash
npm run agent:build
```
You should see: `✅ No errors`

#### Step 2: Open Extensions Panel
1. In Replit IDE, look at the **left sidebar**
2. Click the **🧩 puzzle piece icon** (Extensions)
3. Switch to the **"Installed"** tab at the top

#### Step 3: Find Your Extension
You should see:
```
📦 GPT-5 Replit Agent
   v1.0.0
   Autonomous GPT-5 agent with reasoning, memory, and workspace control
```

#### Step 4: Activate It
1. Click on **"GPT-5 Replit Agent"**
2. Click **"Activate"** or **"Open Panel"**
3. The extension loads in the browser context (no more errors!)

#### Step 5: Verify It's Running
The extension will:
- Initialize in the browser iframe
- Show a notification: "GPT-5 Agent loaded successfully"
- Log to browser console: "GPT-5 Agent ready - context configured"

### 🔍 Checking Logs

**Browser Console Logs:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab
3. Look for:
   ```
   GPT-5 Agent initialized
   GPT-5 Agent ready - context configured
   ```

**If Extension Doesn't Appear:**
- Make sure `extension.json` is in project root ✅ (it is)
- Make sure build completed ✅ (it did)
- Refresh the Extensions panel
- Try reopening the Replit workspace

## 🎨 Current Extension Capabilities

Right now the extension:
- ✅ Initializes @replit/extensions API
- ✅ Shows success notification
- ✅ Configures fs, data, terminal access
- ✅ Logs to console

**What's Missing:**
The extension currently has no UI panel. It runs in background only.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Add UI Panel (Recommended)
Create an interactive panel with:
- Text input for prompts
- Message display area
- Action buttons
- Status indicators

This requires:
1. Creating an HTML interface
2. Adding panel creation code
3. Setting up message passing

### Option B: Background-Only Mode
Keep it as a background extension that:
- Listens for commands via Replit data
- Executes tasks autonomously
- Reports status via notifications

### Option C: Integrate with Vecto Pilot
Connect the agent to your existing Vecto Pilot server:
- Agent runs in browser context
- Calls Vecto APIs at `localhost:3101`
- Provides UI overlay for Vecto features

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Extension doesn't show in Extensions panel"
- Verify `extension.json` exists in project root
- Check that `entry` field points to `src/index.ts`
- Rebuild: `npm run agent:build`
- Refresh Extensions panel

### "Agent panel is blank"
- Expected - no UI is created yet
- Check browser console for logs
- Extension is working in background

### "Can't find Extensions icon"
- Look for 🧩 puzzle piece in left sidebar
- May be collapsed - hover to see icons
- Try refreshing the workspace

## 📊 Verification Checklist

Run through this checklist:

- [x] `extension.json` exists in project root
- [x] `npm run agent:build` completes successfully
- [x] `dist/index.js` and `dist/agent/*` files exist
- [x] `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret is configured
- [ ] Extension appears in Extensions panel (your turn!)
- [ ] Extension activates without errors (your turn!)
- [ ] Browser console shows initialization logs (your turn!)

## 💡 What You Should Do Now

1. **Open the Extensions panel** (🧩 in left sidebar)
2. **Find "GPT-5 Replit Agent"** in the Installed tab
3. **Click "Activate"**
4. **Check browser console** for success logs
5. **Report back** what you see!

If you see the success logs, the agent is working! Then we can discuss whether you want to:
- Add a UI panel for interaction
- Keep it as background service
- Integrate with Vecto Pilot

**Key Takeaway:** Don't run `npm run agent:start` anymore. That's for Node.js servers. This is a browser extension - activate it through the Replit Extensions UI! 🧩
