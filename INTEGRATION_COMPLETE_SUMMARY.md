# ‚úÖ Integration Complete - Ready for Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**All Components Integrated & Documented**

---

## üéØ What's Been Integrated

### 1. Event Enrichment System ‚úÖ
- **Database:** events_facts table, enrichment functions, triggers, coach view
- **Auto-Enrichment:** Runs after every strategy generation
- **Coach Context:** Full snapshot-wide context API endpoint
- **Scripts:** Event seeding, enrichment refresh, smoke tests
- **Documentation:** Complete integration guide with test examples

### 2. Event Proximity Matching ‚úÖ
- **Proximity Association:** Events attach to venues within 350m radius
- **Haversine Distance:** Runtime distance calculations (NO hardcoded locations)
- **Scoring:** Impact + imminence + proximity decay
- **Perplexity Integration:** Prompt templates for event research
- **Database:** Extended schema with coordinates_source, location_quality, radius_hint_m, impact_hint

### 3. Staging Nodes (Entrances/Curb) ‚úÖ
- **Node Classification:** venue vs staging detection
- **Geometry Deduplication:** Coords-first (~50m grid) prevents name-based false closures
- **Access Status:** Inherits from parent complex (mall/venue hours)
- **Staging Priority:** Boost scoring based on serve capacity + nearby events
- **Auto-Reclassification:** Existing entrance rows automatically marked as staging

### 4. Runtime-Fresh Compliance ‚úÖ
- **NO Hardcoded Locations:** CI guard prevents location literals
- **Coordinate-First:** All distances from runtime anchor
- **Validation Gates:** Freshness checks (location ‚â§120s, strategy ‚â§120s, window ‚â§60min)
- **Audit Logging:** Single-line spec format with correlation IDs
- **Time Windowing:** Auto-populated valid_window_start/end fields

## üöÄ Quick Start (30 Seconds)

### Step 1: Fix DATABASE_URL
In Replit Secrets, update your DATABASE_URL to:
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>/neondb?sslmode=require
```
**Remove:** `&channel_binding=require` (causes auth failures)  
**Keep:** `?sslmode=require` (required for Neon)

### Step 2: Test Connection
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT now();"
```
**Expected:** One row with current timestamp

### Step 3: Apply Migrations
```bash
node scripts/postdeploy-sql.mjs
```
**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Connected to database
- ‚úÖ All 3 migrations completed
- ‚úÖ All components verified

### Step 4: Verify No Hardcoded Locations
```bash
node scripts/check-no-hardcoded-location.mjs
```
**Expected:** ‚úÖ No hardcoded location data detected

### Step 5: Test Complete! üéâ
System is ready for field testing.

## üìã Full Test Sequence (5 Minutes)

See **`QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md`** for step-by-step instructions.

**Includes:**
1. Migration application
2. Latest snapshot retrieval (no psql needed)
3. Test event seeding with coordinates
4. Enrichment refresh
5. Coach context API test
6. SQL verification queries

---

## üéØ What to Test

### Event Proximity
1. Seed event with coordinates
2. Refresh enrichment
3. Verify nearby venues get event badge with `nearby=true`
4. Check `offset_m` shows distance in meters
5. Confirm proximity boost in rankings

### Staging Nodes
1. Check existing entrances auto-classified as staging
2. Verify no "Closed" badges on entrance rows
3. Test parent complex hour inheritance
4. Confirm staging priority boost works

### Coach Context
1. Query `/coach/context/:snapshotId`
2. Verify returns complete snapshot view
3. Check includes event data, staging status, weather, etc.

**Required (Already Configured):**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...?sslmode=require
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=...

**Optional (Event Proximity):**
```bash
W_EVENT=1.0                      # Event boost weight
EVENT_ASSOC_RADIUS_M=350         # Proximity matching radius (meters)

## üìä Key Features

### Event Proximity Matching
- ‚úÖ Perplexity returns event coordinates + timing
- ‚úÖ System computes distance from event to ALL candidates
- ‚úÖ Events within 350m radius attach as "nearby"
- ‚úÖ UI shows: `üéÉ Halloween Event nearby ¬∑ ~250m SE ¬∑ 7-10 PM`
- ‚úÖ Rank boost scales with proximity + impact + imminence
- ‚úÖ **NO hardcoded locations** - all from runtime

### Staging Node Classification
- ‚úÖ Entrances/drop-offs auto-detected by name/category
- ‚úÖ Geometry-first deduplication prevents name mismatches
- ‚úÖ Access status inherits from parent complex hours
- ‚úÖ Rank boost when serving many open venues or nearby events
- ‚úÖ UI shows: `STAGING ‚Ä¢ High priority` instead of "Closed"

### Runtime-Fresh Compliance
- ‚úÖ Validation gates: location ‚â§120s, strategy ‚â§120s, window ‚â§60min
- ‚úÖ Audit logging with correlation IDs
- ‚úÖ Time windowing with validity windows
- ‚úÖ Movement detection (500m threshold)
- ‚úÖ Catalog-as-backup normalization only
- ‚úÖ CI guard prevents hardcoded locations

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### "password authentication failed"
**Fix:** Remove `&channel_binding=require` from DATABASE_URL

### "function gen_random_uuid() does not exist"
**Fix:** Migration includes `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;` - rerun postdeploy-sql

### "EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory"
**Fix:** Updated check script includes `nodir: true` and directory skip

### "No snapshots found"
**Fix:** Create a snapshot via UI first, then retry

### "Missing proximity columns"
**Fix:** Run migration 0004: `node scripts/postdeploy-sql.mjs`
