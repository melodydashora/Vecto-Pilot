# Ready for Restart! 🚀

## What I Did

Modified `gateway-server.js` to automatically spawn all 3 servers:
1. **Agent Server** (port 43717) - Starts first
2. **Eidolon SDK** (port 3101) - Starts 2 seconds later  
3. **Gateway** (port 80) - Main process

## After You Restart Replit

**Just click the Run button** - that's it!

The workflow will execute `npm run dev`, which runs `gateway-server.js`, which now automatically spawns both the Agent and SDK servers.

## What Will Happen

```
1. Gateway starts on port 80 ✓
2. Gateway spawns Agent on port 43717 ✓
3. Gateway spawns SDK on port 3101 ✓
4. All 3 servers running ✓
```

## Testing

Once running, your ML health endpoint will be live:
```
http://localhost:80/api/ml/health
```

## Preview URL

Your app will be available at:
```
https://workspace.melodydashora.repl.co
```

## If It Works

You'll see in the console:
- "🚀 Starting Agent Server..."
- "🐕 Starting Eidolon SDK watchdog…"  
- "✅ SDK is healthy and ready"

All your ML infrastructure is ready to capture interactions!

**I'm ready. Just restart and click Run.** 💪
