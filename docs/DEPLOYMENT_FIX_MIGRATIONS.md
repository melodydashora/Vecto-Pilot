# 🔧 Database Migration Fix - Deployment Ready

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Root Cause**: Your project had manual SQL migration files in `drizzle/` that were conflicting with Replit's automatic schema synchronization.

**What Happened**:
1. ❌ Manual SQL files in `drizzle/` folder tried to add CASCADE foreign keys
2. ❌ But `shared/schema.js` already defines these CASCADE behaviors  
3. ❌ Replit's deployment tried to apply both, causing conflicts
4. ❌ Platform reported "migration failed"

**The Fix**:
1. ✅ Moved manual SQL migrations to `migrations/manual/` (out of `drizzle/`)
2. ✅ Replit will now only sync from `shared/schema.js` (which is correct)
3. ✅ No more migration conflicts during deployment

## 📁 What Was Moved

```
migrations/manual/
├── 20251006_add_perf_indexes.sql      (Performance indexes)
├── 20251007_add_fk_cascade.sql        (FK cascade - duplicate)
└── 20251007_fk_cascade_fix.sql        (FK cascade fix - duplicate)
```

**Note**: Your `shared/schema.js` already has the correct CASCADE behavior:
```javascript
// Line 37 - strategies table
snapshot_id: uuid("snapshot_id").references(() => snapshots.snapshot_id, 
  { onDelete: 'cascade' })

// Line 78 - ranking_candidates table  
ranking_id: uuid("ranking_id").references(() => rankings.ranking_id,
  { onDelete: 'cascade' })

// Lines 124-125 - actions table
ranking_id: uuid("ranking_id").references(() => rankings.ranking_id,
  { onDelete: 'cascade' })
snapshot_id: uuid("snapshot_id").references(() => snapshots.snapshot_id,
  { onDelete: 'cascade' })
```

## 🚀 Deploy Now

Your deployment should now work. Here's what to do:

### 1. Update `.replit` (Manual Step)

Open `.replit` and make these changes:

```toml
[deployment]
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci --omit=dev && npm run build"]
run = ["sh", "-c", "./start-mono.sh"]  ← Use the startup script
```

Ensure only ONE `[[ports]]` entry:
```toml
[[ports]]
localPort = 5174
externalPort = 80
```

### 2. Deploy to Autoscale

1. Go to the **Deployments** pane in Replit
2. Click **"Deploy"**
3. Select **"Autoscale"** deployment
4. Monitor the deployment logs

### Expected Deployment Flow:

```
✓ Build starts
✓ npm ci --omit=dev (installs dependencies)
✓ npm run build (builds frontend with Vite)
✓ Database sync from shared/schema.js (automatic, no manual migrations)
✓ Container starts with ./start-mono.sh
✓ App binds to 0.0.0.0:$PORT
✓ Health check passes on /
✓ Deployment succeeds! 🎉
```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

Replit's deployment system:
- ✅ **Automatically syncs** database schema from `shared/schema.js` to production
- ❌ **Gets confused** by manual SQL files in `drizzle/` folder
- ⚠️ **Reports "platform issue"** when migrations conflict

**Best Practice**: 
- Always define schema in `shared/schema.js` using Drizzle ORM
- Avoid manual SQL migration files in `drizzle/`
- Use `npm run db:push` for development schema changes

## 🧪 Verify Locally (Optional)

Test that the app still works locally:

```bash
# Start the app
./start-mono.sh

# Wait 5 seconds, then test health
curl http://localhost:5174/health
# Should return: OK

curl http://localhost:5174/healthz  
# Should return: {"ok":true,"mode":"mono",...}
```

## 📊 Manual Migrations (If Needed Later)

The moved SQL files in `migrations/manual/` are:

1. **20251006_add_perf_indexes.sql** - Performance indexes
   - This might be useful if your production database is slow
   - Can apply manually via Replit Database pane if needed

2. **20251007_add_fk_cascade.sql** & **20251007_fk_cascade_fix.sql**
   - ❌ **Not needed** - Schema already has CASCADE behavior
   - Can be safely ignored

### How to Apply Manual Migrations (If Needed):

**Option 1: Via Replit Database Pane**
1. Open the Database pane in Replit
2. Switch to "Production Database"
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Paste the SQL from `migrations/manual/20251006_add_perf_indexes.sql`
5. Execute

**Option 2: Via Command Line** (Development DB only)
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/manual/20251006_add_perf_indexes.sql
```

## 🐛 If Deployment Still Fails

If you still see migration errors:

1. **Check deployment logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify DATABASE_URL** is set in deployment secrets (pooled connection)
3. **Contact Replit support** if the error persists with these details:
   - Mention you moved manual migrations out of `drizzle/`
   - Your schema is in `shared/schema.js`
   - You're using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL

## ✨ Summary

**Before**: 
- ❌ Manual SQL migrations in `drizzle/` causing conflicts
- ❌ Deployment failing with "migration failed" error

**After**:
- ✅ Manual migrations moved to `migrations/manual/`
- ✅ Schema sync from `shared/schema.js` only
- ✅ Deployment should succeed

**Next Step**: Update `.replit` and deploy! 🚀

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ Moved `drizzle/*.sql` → `migrations/manual/*.sql`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_MIGRATIONS.md` (this file)
- ⏳ `.replit` - **Waiting for your manual update**

Your app is now ready for successful Autoscale deployment!
