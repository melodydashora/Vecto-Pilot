# Implementation Plans

This directory contains formal implementation plans for significant changes to the codebase.

## Active Plans

| Plan | Status | Priority | Created |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| [AUDIT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](./AUDIT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md) | AWAITING APPROVAL | P0/P1/P2 | 2026-01-06 |

## Plan Lifecycle

1. **DRAFT** - Plan being written
2. **AWAITING APPROVAL** - Ready for Melody's review
3. **APPROVED** - Ready for implementation
4. **IN PROGRESS** - Implementation underway
5. **COMPLETED** - All tasks done, tests passed
6. **ARCHIVED** - Historical reference

## Creating a New Plan

Per CLAUDE.md Rule 1:
> **BEFORE making any code changes**, create a plan document in the same directory as the relevant README.md

Plans must include:
- Objectives
- Approach
- Files affected
- Test cases

## Approval Process

Implementation requires **formal testing approval from Melody**:
- Melody confirms: "All tests passed"
- Only then proceed with implementation
