# Pending Documentation Review

Items flagged by the Change Analyzer for human-AI validation.

## Note from Melody - repo owner
1. docs/review-queue has daily scripts ran that try to find repo changes (wether documented or not)
2. each md in the docs/review-queue will have changed files and folders and will be consolidated into the pending.md meaning this file gets large fast.
3. read all root file *.md and make sure they all match the current codebase
4. come back and move all dated yyyy-mm-dd.md to docs/reviewed-queue to validate the changes that were missed (historical md files need to be read in reverse order and changes (even one lie code changes) and add them to (and if not created) the CHANGES.md file in the docs/reviewed-queue folder making sure to know date of change from file name and because the changes snowball be cognizant of duplicated listed changes and summary to help us to not only keep up with documentation but gives us historical changes and to not make mistakes in reversion coding.)
5. after no yyyy-mm-dd.md files are left compare the CHANGES.md file with updates found further down in this file and verify all changes are now kept in the CHANGES.md and delete the changes listed in this document.
6. Follow the "How to Use This File" but make sure they are not kept here and instead appended to the CHANGES.md with dates and summarized changes - that file can and will get huge but we will not miss a single change and it will act as your memory. Nothing should be deleted from CHANGES.md with the exception of duplicated changes.
