# AI Partnership Checkpoint

**Created:** December 15, 2024
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE

## Phase 1: Split ARCHITECTURE.md - COMPLETE

All documents created and ARCHITECTURE.md slimmed down to pointer file.

### Documents Created (7 total)

1. `docs/architecture/server-structure.md` - Backend organization
2. `docs/architecture/client-structure.md` - Frontend organization
3. `docs/architecture/auth-system.md` - JWT authentication
4. `docs/architecture/logging.md` - Workflow logging
5. `docs/architecture/deprecated.md` - Removed features (DO NOT re-implement)
6. `docs/architecture/decisions.md` - WHY we made choices
7. `docs/architecture/strategy-framework.md` - 13-component pipeline

### Other Changes

- Updated `docs/architecture/README.md` as master index with navigation guide
- Slimmed `ARCHITECTURE.md` from 2325 lines to 107 lines (pointer file)

## Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ARCHITECTURE.md lines | 2,325 | 107 |
| Focused docs | 6 | 13 |
| Avg doc size | Variable | <300 lines |

## What's Next

**Phase 2: Pre-flight Check System**
- Create `docs/preflight/` folder with quick-reference cards
- Update `get_guidelines` MCP tool
- Add preflight checklist to CLAUDE.md

See `docs/AI_PARTNERSHIP_PLAN.md` for full roadmap.

## Context

User's goal: Transform Claude from a tool into a partner with:
- Chunked documentation I can actually read
- Pre-flight checks before edits
- Memory layer across sessions
- Self-healing documentation
