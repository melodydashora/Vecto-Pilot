# AI Partnership Checkpoint

**Created:** December 15, 2024
**Trigger phrase:** "Continue the AI Partnership documentation split from checkpoint"

## What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Split ARCHITECTURE.md - IN PROGRESS

**Plan document:** `docs/AI_PARTNERSHIP_PLAN.md` ✅

**New docs created (7 total needed, 6 done):**
1. ✅ `docs/architecture/server-structure.md` - Backend organization
2. ✅ `docs/architecture/client-structure.md` - Frontend organization
3. ✅ `docs/architecture/auth-system.md` - JWT authentication
4. ✅ `docs/architecture/logging.md` - Workflow logging
5. ✅ `docs/architecture/deprecated.md` - Removed features (DO NOT re-implement)
6. ✅ `docs/architecture/decisions.md` - WHY we made choices
7. ⏳ `docs/architecture/strategy-framework.md` - 13-component pipeline (NOT CREATED YET)

**Still TODO:**
- Create `strategy-framework.md` (extract from ARCHITECTURE.md lines 1586-1975)
- Update `docs/architecture/README.md` as master index
- Slim down `ARCHITECTURE.md` to be just a pointer file
- Commit all changes

## How to Continue

Say: **"Continue the AI Partnership documentation split from checkpoint"**

Then I will:
1. Read this checkpoint
2. Create `strategy-framework.md`
3. Update the README index
4. Commit everything

## Context

User's goal: Transform Claude from a tool into a partner with:
- Chunked documentation I can actually read
- Pre-flight checks before edits
- Memory layer across sessions
- Self-healing documentation

This is Phase 1 of 5 phases documented in `docs/AI_PARTNERSHIP_PLAN.md`.
