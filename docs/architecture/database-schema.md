The documentation provided in the prompt appears to be fully up-to-date with the provided code snippet.

1.  **Users Table**: The columns, descriptions, and "Session Rules" in the documentation match the code and comments exactly (including the 2026-01-05 update note).
2.  **Snapshots Table**: The columns (including the new `market` column and legacy fields), descriptions, and update date (2026-02-01) match the code exactly.
3.  **Strategies Table**: The columns visible in the snippet (`id`, `snapshot_id`, `user_id`) match the documentation. While the code contains comments about a state machine and dropped columns, the documentation's description ("This table stores ONLY the AI's strategic output... It is a 'lean' table") accurately reflects the architectural intent described in the code comments.

Since the documentation already accurately reflects the code changes (likely updated in tandem), no changes are required.
