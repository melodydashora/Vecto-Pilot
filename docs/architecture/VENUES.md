## 1. SmartBlocks Generation Pipeline

**File:** `server/lib/venue/enhanced-smart-blocks.js`

```
generateEnhancedSmartBlocks(snapshotId)
  │
  ├─ Input: immediateStrategy + briefing + snapshot
  │
  ├─ Step 1: VENUE_SCORER (tactical-planner.js)
  │  └─ callModel('VENUE_SCORER') → GPT-5.4 (reasoningEffort: medium)
  │  └─ Returns 4–8 venue recommendations with coords, category, pro_tips, staging info
  │
  ├─ Step 2: enrichVenues() (venue-enrichment.js)
  │  ├─ Google Places API: resolve place_id, address, business hours, status
  │  ├─ Google Routes API: batch drive time + distance from driver
  │  └─ Filter permanently closed venues
  │
  ├─ Step 3: matchVenuesToEvents() (event-matcher.js)
  │  └─ 2026-04-11: Match via place_id (primary) → venue_id → name fallback.
  │     Events are pre-fetched state-scoped by the caller at the top of the
  │     pipeline (fetchTodayDiscoveredEventsWithVenue with driver coords,
  │     60-mile metro context radius, distance-annotated, closest-first
  │     sorted). The matcher uses strong identity keys instead of address
  │     strings and does not re-query the DB. Distance plays no role in the
  │     matcher itself — by the time it runs, VENUE_SCORER has only picked
  │     venues within 15 miles of the driver, so far-bucket events naturally
  │     produce no matches (they were never candidates).
  │
  ├─ Step 4: verifyVenueEventsBatch() (venue-event-verifier.js)
  │  └─ Gemini verifies event relevance per venue
  │
  ├─ Step 5: promoteToVenueCatalog() 
  │  └─ Upsert verified venues to venue_catalog (canonical identity)
  │
  └─ Step 6: Write to rankings + ranking_candidates tables
```

## 2. Venue Scoring and Ranking

### VENUE_SCORER Response Schema

**File:** `server/lib/strategy/tactical-planner.js` (lines 41–66)

```typescript
VenueRecommendation {
  name: string;                    // Venue name (1-200 chars)
  lat, lng: number;                // Coordinates
  staging_lat, staging_lng: number; // WHERE TO PARK (separate from venue)
  staging_name: string;            // "Nearby parking lot name"
  district: string;                // "Legacy West", "Deep Ellum"
  category: enum;                  // airport|entertainment|shopping|dining|sports_venue|transit_hub|hotel|nightlife|event_venue|other
  pro_tips: string[];              // 1-3 tactical tips (max 500 chars each)
  strategic_timing: string;        // "Opens in 30 min", "Event at 7 PM"
}
```

### Value Scoring (Post-Enrichment) — HEURISTIC

> **Note:** This is a distance-based heuristic, not an economic model. The $1.50/mile rate is a static estimate with no surge, airport, or offer data. See §11 Known Gaps.

```javascript
estimatedEarnings = distanceMiles * $1.50/mile;  // static rate
valuePerMin = estimatedEarnings / driveTimeMinutes;

// Grading:
'A' → valuePerMin >= $1.00/min  (premium)
'B' → valuePerMin >= $0.50/min  (good)
'C' → valuePerMin < $0.50/min   (standard)
notWorth → valuePerMin < $0.30   (flagged)
```

### Rank-Based Model Score

```javascript
model_score = 1.0 - (rank * 0.1);
// Rank 1: 1.0, Rank 2: 0.9, Rank 3: 0.8, etc.
```

### Sorting

Blocks sorted by: `valuePerMin DESC` (highest earnings first), then `estimatedDistanceMiles ASC` (closest within same tier). Filtered to within 25 miles.

## 3. Google Places Integration

### APIs Used

| API | Purpose | File |
|-----|---------|------|
| Places SearchNearby | Find venue by coords (500m radius, top 3) | `venue-enrichment.js` |
| Places SearchText | Fallback: find venue by name + district + city | `venue-enrichment.js` |
| Places GetByPlaceId | Enrich venue with hours, rating, phone | `venue-enrichment.js` |
| Routes Matrix | Batch drive time/distance (1 origin, N destinations) | `venue-enrichment.js` |
| Geocoding | Reverse geocode for address resolution | `venue-address-resolver.js` |

### Caching Strategy

1. **In-memory cache** (6h TTL) — fastest
2. **Database cache** (`places_cache` table, keyed by `coords_key`) — persistent
3. **Google API** — fallback with retry logic

### Business Hours Calculation

```javascript
// Canonical pipeline:
Google weekdayDescriptions → parseGoogleWeekdayText() → getOpenStatus()
// Returns: { is_open, hours_today, closing_soon, minutes_until_close, opens_in_minutes }
// CRITICAL: Requires driver's timezone — returns null if missing
```

### Permanently Closed Filtering

```javascript
if (placeDetails.business_status === 'CLOSED_PERMANENTLY') {
  return null; // Filtered out entirely — never shown to driver
}
```

## 5. Venue Filtering and Classification

### VENUE_FILTER Role (Haiku)

**File:** `server/api/venue/venue-intelligence.js` (lines 243–335)

Classifies venues into tiers:
- **P (PREMIUM):** Upscale lounges, cocktail bars, rooftop bars, speakeasies, high-end nightclubs
- **S (STANDARD):** Sports bars, casual pubs, breweries, taphouses
- **X (REMOVE):** Fast food, pizza, coffee, ice cream, gas stations, grocery stores

### Hardcoded Exclusion Set

Fast food chains (McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.), coffee shops (Starbucks, Dunkin'), grocery stores (Kroger, Walmart), gas stations — all excluded before classification.

### Closed Venue Handling

- **Permanently closed:** Filtered out entirely
- **Temporarily closed:** Shown with `isOpen: false` + `closedVenueReasoning`
- **Opening soon:** Shown with `opensInMinutes` countdown
- **Strategy value:** `strategic_timing` field from VENUE_SCORER explains why a closed venue is worth staging near

---

## 6. Venue-to-Driver Matching

### Distance Calculation

- **Primary:** Google Routes Matrix API (drive time with traffic)
- **Fallback:** Individual route calls if batch fails
- **Filter:** Venues beyond 25 miles excluded
- **Conversion:** `distanceMeters × 0.000621371 = distanceMiles`

### Coordinate Precision

`coord_key` format: `33.123456_-96.123456` (6 decimal places = ~11cm accuracy). Used for deduplication in venue_catalog.

---

## 7. Event Matching and Enrichment

### Event-to-Venue Linking

**File:** `server/lib/venue/event-matcher.js`

```javascript
// 2026-04-11: Rewritten to use strong identity keys. No longer async, no longer
// queries the DB — caller (enhanced-smart-blocks.js) pre-fetches events via
// fetchTodayDiscoveredEventsWithVenue(state, eventDate, driverLat, driverLng, 60)
// and passes them in. The caller supplies distance annotation and closest-first
// sort; the matcher itself is distance-agnostic.
matchVenuesToEvents(enrichedVenues, todayEvents)
// Match priority: place_id → venue_id → name fallback
// Returns Map<venueName, Event[]>
```

### Smart Blocks ↔ Event Venue Coordination (NEAR / FAR Bucket Model)

The venue-to-event relationship is governed by the 15-mile rule: `VENUE_SCORER` may only recommend venues within 15 miles of the driver's GPS coordinates, even when events exist in the metro. Event data enriches Smart Blocks via a two-bucket model applied at the prompt-formatting layer (`server/lib/briefing/filter-for-planner.js :: formatBriefingForPrompt`):

- **NEAR EVENTS (≤ 15 mi from driver):** Candidate venues. `VENUE_SCORER` recommends these event venues directly with event-specific `pro_tips`.
- **FAR EVENTS (> 15 mi from driver):** Surge flow intelligence, NOT destinations. `VENUE_SCORER` uses them to reason about demand origination (attendees depart FROM areas near the driver TO the far venue) and recommends close high-impact venues that benefit from the outflow.

The 60-mile metro context radius at the fetch layer is decoupled from the 15-mile venue-eligibility rule at the prompt layer: the former is a data-layer cap on what's worth reasoning over, the latter is a tactical-layer constraint on what to recommend as a destination.

**Canonical reference:** `docs/EVENTS.md` § 10. Full history: `server/lib/venue/SMART_BLOCKS_EVENT_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`.

### Time Relevance Filter

```javascript
isEventTimeRelevant(eventStartTime, snapshotTimezone)
// Returns true if event starts within NEXT 2 hours OR started within LAST 4 hours
```

### Event Badge Rendering

```javascript
hasEvent = venue_events.length > 0 && isEventTimeRelevant(...)
eventBadge = venue_events[0].title  // First event title
eventSummary = `${category} at ${event_start_time}`
```

---

## 8. Client-Side: How Venues Appear in UI

### SmartBlocks Response (blocks-fast GET)

**File:** `server/validation/transformers.js` → `toApiBlock()`

Each block sent to client:
```typescript
{
  name, address, coordinates: {lat, lng},
  placeId, estimatedDistanceMiles, driveTimeMinutes,
  distanceSource, valuePerMin, valueGrade, notWorth,
  surge, estimatedEarningsPerRide, estimatedWaitTime, demandLevel,
  proTips: string[],
  closedVenueReasoning: string | null,
  stagingArea: { parkingTip } | null,
  isOpen: boolean | null,
  businessHours, businessStatus,
  streetViewUrl,
  hasEvent: boolean, eventBadge: string | null
}
```

### useBarsQuery Hook

**File:** `client/src/hooks/useBarsQuery.ts`

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/venues/nearby?lat=&lng=&city=&state=&radius=25&timezone=`
- **Cache:** 5-min staleTime, 10-min gcTime
- **Returns:** `{ venues: Venue[], lastCallVenues: Venue[] }`

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `/api/blocks-fast` | POST | requireAuth | Full waterfall: briefing → strategy → venues |
| `/api/blocks-fast?snapshotId=X` | GET | requireAuth | Fetch generated blocks |
| `/api/venues/nearby` | GET | requireAuth | Bar/lounge discovery for Bar Tab |

## 11. Known Gaps

1. **No driver preference influence on venue scoring** — `generateEnhancedSmartBlocks()` accepts `user_id` but only uses it for ranking record attribution. Scoring and filtering ignore driver preferences entirely. The strategist layer was enriched with driver prefs (2026-04-11) but the venue layer was not. Specific preferences that should be threaded through:
   - **max_deadhead_mi** — Filter venues beyond the driver's deadhead tolerance (currently hardcoded 25mi)
   - **Home base bias** — Prefer venues closer to home for end-of-shift positioning
   - **Vehicle/service eligibility** — Exclude venues requiring vehicle types the driver doesn't have (e.g., airport queue requires TLC plates)
2. **No venue freshness tracking** — A venue's hours from 3 months ago are treated the same as today's data.
3. ~~**Event matching is fuzzy** — String-based name matching can miss or mismatch venues.~~ **Resolved 2026-04-11:** `event-matcher.js` rewritten to use `place_id` as the primary match key (both sides Google-sourced → invariant across formatting drift), with `venue_id` as secondary and substantial-name-match as a tertiary fallback.
4. **Value scoring is a distance heuristic, not economic truth** — `estimatedEarnings = distanceMiles × $1.50/mile` (static). No surge multiplier, airport queue premium, or offer intelligence data. The A/B/C grade (`valuePerMin`) measures drive-efficiency, not actual earning potential. See `enhanced-smart-blocks.js:495`.
5. **Venue catalog grows unbounded** — No cleanup of permanently closed or unused venues.
6. **No venue popularity signal** — Missing data on which venues actually produce rides.

---

## 12. TODO — Hardening Work

- [ ] **Integrate surge pricing into value scoring** — Use real-time surge multipliers from offer intelligence
- [ ] **Add venue freshness TTL** — Re-check business hours if data older than 7 days
- [ ] **Driver preference-aware scoring** — Thread max_deadhead_mi (filter), home base bias (end-of-shift), vehicle/service eligibility (exclusion) into venue scoring via `loadDriverPreferences(user_id)`
- [ ] **Venue popularity from ride history** — Track which venues drivers get rides from (via offer intelligence)
- [x] ~~**Place_id-based event matching** — Use Google Place IDs instead of fuzzy name matching~~ (Resolved 2026-04-11 — `event-matcher.js` rewritten with `place_id` → `venue_id` → name fallback)
- [ ] **Venue catalog cleanup job** — Archive permanently closed venues, prune unused stubs older than 90 days
- [ ] **Real-time surge overlay** — Show surge zones on venue map markers
