# Legacy Architecture Docs

Outdated architecture documentation pending review.

## Purpose

Architecture documents that:
- Reference old code structure
- Have outdated diagrams
- Need alignment with current implementation

## Contents

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `urgent/` | High-priority documents needing immediate attention |

## Review Process

1. Compare with current `docs/architecture/` docs
2. Identify what's still accurate
3. Merge useful content into main docs
4. Archive or delete remainder
