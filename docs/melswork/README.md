# Mel's Work

Documentation maintained by Mel (project owner).

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `needs-updating/` | Documents that need review and updates |
| `repo/` | Repository documentation (if present) |

## Purpose

This folder separates owner-maintained documentation from auto-generated or developer documentation.

## Workflow

1. Documents start in `needs-updating/` when they become stale
2. After review and update, move to appropriate `docs/` location
3. Archive or delete obsolete documents
