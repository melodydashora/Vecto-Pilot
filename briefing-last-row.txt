      "impact": "high",
      "source": "The Texas Tribune / Dallas Observer",
      "summary": "A major developing story today (Jan 5) confirms Plano and Irving officials are advancing plans to withdraw from DART and replace fixed bus routes with 'microtransit'—essentially city-subsidized Uber/Lyft rides. While the vote is in May, this signals a potential massive future shift in demand for drivers in these suburbs. Expect increased discussion and potential pilot programs.",

      "impact": "high",
      "source": "Dallas News / CBS Texas",
      "summary": "Effective January 3, 2025, Dallas Love Field Airport relocated the pickup area for app-based rideshares (Uber, Lyft, Wingz) from Garage B to the Valet Pavilion and Garage C (Level 1), on the terminal’s southeast side. The new spot shortens the walk for passengers (about 6 minutes instead of ~10), making pickups quicker. For drivers, this reduces drive‐time waiting or locating passengers, speeds up turnover, and may reduce idle time. Could lead to more ride acceptance from Love Field if pickups become less frustrating for both drivers and riders.

For Frisco area drivers, that means fuel costs are increasing—compressing profit margins and raising the importance of planning fuel‐efficient trips or seeking bonuses that cover fuel costs. Earnings per ride may need to be higher to maintain same take-home.
