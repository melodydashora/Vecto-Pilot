  "recommendations": "For DFW: Drivers must use the designated Terminal B or E infield lots to enter the FIFO queue. Do not circle terminals. 'Pre-Match' alerts may prompt you to move toward terminals before a request comes in. \n\nFor DAL: All rideshare pickups are located at Garage C, Level 1 (Valet Pavilion). Do not attempt curbside pickups at the terminal baggage claim; you will be ticketed. Monday mornings are high-demand; position yourself in the staging area by 5:00 AM for early airport runs."
