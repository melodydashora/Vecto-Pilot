  "recommendations": "For DFW: Drivers should wait in the designated staging lot near Terminal A. Pickups are at the 'Green Curb' on the lower level for Terminals A, D, and E, and inside the parking garages for B and C. \n\nFor DAL: **Important:** Rideshare pickups are located at the Valet Pavilion and Garage C (Level 1). Do not wait at the curbside arrivals area unless picking up an ADA/accessible ride. The walk for passengers to the pickup zone takes about 6 minutes, so verify they are at the 'Ride App Pickup' zone before pulling up."
