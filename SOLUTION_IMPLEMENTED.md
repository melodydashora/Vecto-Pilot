# ‚úÖ Solution Implemented - Correct Architecture

## What Was Wrong Before

My previous understanding was completely incorrect:
- ‚ùå I thought there were "workflows" we could create programmatically
- ‚ùå I thought processes could stay alive if started from shell
- ‚ùå I didn't understand PORT was the one public port

## The Real Replit Rules (Now Implemented)

1. **Only the Run button process stays alive** - Everything else gets reaped
2. **process.env.PORT is the ONE public port** - Everything else must be localhost
3. **Gateway must supervise child processes** - Not spawn and forget

## What I Fixed

### 1. Gateway as Single Public Server
- Gateway listens on `0.0.0.0:${process.env.PORT}` (public)
- SDK forced to `127.0.0.1:3101` (private)
- Agent forced to `127.0.0.1:43717` (private)
- Vite forced to `127.0.0.1:5173` (private)

### 2. Process Supervisor Pattern
```javascript
function spawnSvc(label, cmd, args, opts) {
  // Spawns child process
  // Forces HOST=127.0.0.1 and PORT=opts.port
  // Auto-restarts on exit with backoff
  // Tracks all children for cleanup
}
```

### 3. Fixed Vite HMR Port Collision
- Pinned HMR to port 24700 (was randomly trying 24678)
- Single Vite instance created once
- No more "Port 24678 is already in use" errors

### 4. Proper WebSocket Handling
- All WebSocket upgrades routed through gateway
- Agent WebSockets ‚Üí 127.0.0.1:43717
- SDK WebSockets ‚Üí 127.0.0.1:3101
- Vite HMR ‚Üí 127.0.0.1:5173

## How It Works Now

When you click **Run**:
1. Replit executes `npm run dev`
2. This starts `gateway-server.js` on PORT (e.g., 8080)
3. Gateway spawns SDK as child process on localhost:3101
4. Gateway spawns Agent as child process on localhost:43717
5. Gateway creates Vite dev server on localhost:5173
6. All requests proxy through gateway to correct localhost service
7. If any child dies, supervisor restarts it automatically

## Testing

Click the Run button and watch for:
```
üöÄ [gateway] Starting in DEVELOPMENT mode
üöÄ [gateway] Port configuration: { Gateway: 8080 (public), SDK: 3101 (private), Agent: 43717 (private), Vite: 5173 (private) }
üêï Starting supervised child processes...
[eidolon-sdk] Starting on port 3101...
[agent] Starting on port 43717...
[db] Vector DB ready ‚úÖ
[gateway] Vite dev middleware active
[gateway] Vite HMR pinned to port 24700
‚úÖ [gateway] SDK ready on port 3101
‚úÖ [gateway] Agent ready on port 43717
‚úÖ [gateway] All backends ready
```

## Key Changes from Before

| Before (Wrong) | After (Correct) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Multiple public ports | One public PORT only |
| Processes on 0.0.0.0 | Children on 127.0.0.1 |
| HMR random ports | HMR pinned to 24700 |
| Spawn and forget | Supervised with restart |
| Complex workflows | Simple Run button |

## Files Modified

- **gateway-server.js** - Complete rewrite with supervisor pattern
- **Backup saved as** - gateway-server.backup.js

## Why This Works

- Gateway is the only process Replit keeps alive (started by Run button)
- Gateway supervises all children internally
- All services on localhost, only gateway public
- Automatic restart keeps everything running
- No port conflicts because everything is pinned
