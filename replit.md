# Vecto Pilot‚Ñ¢ - Rideshare Intelligence Platform

## Overview
Vecto Pilot is an AI-powered rideshare intelligence platform designed for Dallas-Fort Worth rideshare drivers. Its primary goal is to maximize driver earnings by providing real-time strategic briefings. The platform achieves this by integrating and analyzing location intelligence, venue events, traffic, weather, and air quality data. It leverages a multi-AI pipeline to generate actionable strategies, delivered through a React-based web interface, enabling drivers to make data-driven decisions to increase their income.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
Vecto Pilot is a full-stack Node.js application built with a multi-service architecture, supporting both monolithic (mono) and split deployment.

### Core Services
-   **Gateway Server**: Handles client traffic (HTTP/WebSocket), serves the React SPA, routes requests, and manages child processes in split mode.
-   **SDK Server**: Contains the business logic, providing a REST API for data services (location, venue, weather, air quality), snapshot creation, and the ML data pipeline.
-   **Agent Server**: Manages workspace intelligence, offering secure, token-based access to file system operations, shell commands, and database queries.

### AI Configuration
A three-stage AI pipeline generates strategic briefings:
1.  **Claude Opus 4.1**: Performs initial strategic analysis from snapshot data.
2.  **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Provides local news briefings in JSON format.
3.  **GPT-5**: Consolidates outputs into the final actionable intelligence.
Model configurations are centralized, and news briefings are stored for UI display.

### Frontend Architecture
The user interface is a **React + TypeScript Single Page Application (SPA)** developed with Vite. It utilizes Radix UI for accessible components, TailwindCSS for styling, and React Query for server state management.

### Data Storage
A **PostgreSQL Database** serves as the primary data store, with Drizzle ORM managing the schema. It includes tables for snapshots, strategies, venue events, and ML training data. The system uses enhanced memory systems: `cross_thread_memory` for system-wide state, `eidolon_memory` for agent-scoped sessions, and `assistant_memory` for user preferences.

### Authentication & Security
The system employs **JWT with RS256 Asymmetric Keys**, featuring a 15-minute token expiry and 90-day key rotation. Security middleware includes rate limiting, CORS, Helmet.js, path traversal protection, and file size limits.

### API Structure
APIs are categorized into:
-   **Location Services**: Geocoding, timezone, weather, air quality, location snapshots.
-   **Venue Intelligence**: Venue search, event research, smart block strategy generation.
-   **Diagnostics & Health**: Service health, memory diagnostics, job metrics.
-   **Agent Capabilities**: Secure endpoints for file system operations, shell execution, database queries, and memory management.

### Deployment & Preview Reliability
The system supports both **Mono Mode** (single process) and **Split Mode** (gateway spawns SDK and Agent as child processes) to offer deployment flexibility, including on Replit.

**Preview Reliability Architecture:**
-   **Canonical Entry Point**: `scripts/start-replit.js` spawns gateway-server.js with health gate
-   **PORT Binding**: Deterministic binding to port 5000 (ENV var configurable)
-   **Health Gate**: Health polling at `/api/health` ensures preview only resolves when server is ready
-   **Zombie Process Cleanup**: `start-clean.sh` kills leftover node processes before restart
-   **Artifact Discipline**: `dist/` contains only agent TypeScript build output (`index.js`, `agent-ai-config.js`); server runs from canonical `server/*.js` sources
-   **Fast-Fail Boot**: Server exits immediately on bind errors or missing strategy providers
-   **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/api/health`, `/healthz`, `/ready` for different monitoring needs

### Data Integrity & Coordinate-First Policy
All geographic computations must originate from snapshot coordinates. Names are for display only. All enrichment operations must be completed before returning a 200 OK. **Missing business hours default to "unknown" and never "closed"** - this prevents false "closed" states (e.g., IKEA showing closed when hours data is unavailable). All hour calculations use the venue-local timezone. Error responses consistently include `error`, `message`, and `correlationId`.

### Address & Origin Invariance Policy
The driver's precise address must be captured once, normalized to rooftop geocoding precision, and propagated unchanged through the entire pipeline (Strategy ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí DB ‚Üí UI). All stages must read the origin from the snapshot; re-geocoding or substitution is not allowed. The system requires rooftop precision geocoding for all addresses.

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
-   **AI & Research**: Anthropic API (Claude), OpenAI API (GPT-5), Google Gemini API, Perplexity API.
-   **Location & Mapping**: Google Maps API (Routes API, Places API, Text Search API).
-   **Weather and Air Quality**: Configured via environment variables.

### Database
-   **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store, schema managed by Drizzle ORM, with support for vector database capabilities and Row-Level Security (RLS).

### Infrastructure
-   **Replit Platform**: Used for deployment, Nix environment, and `.replit` workflow configuration.
-   **Process Management**: Node.js `child_process` for multi-process environments, `http-proxy` for routing.

### Frontend Libraries
-   **UI Components**: Radix UI, Chart.js.
-   **State Management**: React Query, React Context API.
-   **Development Tools**: Vite, ESLint, TypeScript, PostCSS, TailwindCSS.

## Code Hygiene & Import Management

### Unused Import Policy
**Rule: Use it, remove it, or annotate it with expiry**

All unused imports must be:
1. **Removed** if no longer needed, with documentation in this file
2. **Annotated** with `@reason` and `expiry: YYYY-MM-DD` if intentionally staged
3. **Documented** with strikethrough history showing when and why removed

### Import History (Strikethrough Record)

#### ~~`getPlaceHours`, `findPlaceIdByText` in venue-enrichment.js~~ (Removed 2025-10-30)
- **Status**: Removed - were greyed/unused imports
- **Reason**: Hours normalization moved to `getPlaceDetails()` local function in venue-enrichment.js; these helpers only used in venue-discovery.js
- **History**: Imported from places-hours.js but never called in venue-enrichment.js
- **Resolution**: Removed import, added annotation comment documenting removal
- **CorrelationId**: ENRICH-412
- **Still Used In**: server/lib/venue-discovery.js (legitimate usage remains)

## Preview Reliability Status

### Current State: ‚ö†Ô∏è Preview Not Resolving
**Issue**: Workflow configuration not using health-gated entry point

### Root Cause
The `.replit` workflow runs `node gateway-server.js` directly without health gating. Preview may be waiting for a signal that never comes.

**Current Configuration:**
```ini
[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "set -a && source mono-mode.env && set +a && node gateway-server.js"
```

**What We Built:**
- ‚úÖ `scripts/start-replit.js` with health gate polling `/api/health`
- ‚úÖ `/api/health` endpoint in gateway-server.js
- ‚úÖ `start-clean.sh` for zombie process cleanup
- ‚úÖ Strategy provider validation on boot

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `.replit` workflow not using the health-gated entry point (file is restricted from automated edits)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `package.json` scripts need `start:replit` added (file is restricted from automated edits)

### Manual Configuration Required

#### 1. Update `.replit` Workflow
Change line 31 in `.replit` from:
```ini
args = "set -a && source mono-mode.env && set +a && node gateway-server.js"
```

To use health-gated entry:
```ini
args = "set -a && source mono-mode.env && set +a && npm run start:replit"
```

Or for zombie cleanup:
```ini
args = "set -a && source mono-mode.env && set +a && ./start-clean.sh"
```

#### 2. Add `package.json` Scripts
Add to the `"scripts"` section:
```json
"prestart:replit": "npm run agent:build",
"start:replit": "node scripts/start-replit.js"
```

### Testing Preview Resolution
After manual configuration:
1. Restart workflow
2. Wait for `[boot] ‚úÖ Health check passed` in logs
3. Preview should auto-resolve when health gate succeeds
4. Verify: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health` returns `{"ok":true,"port":5000,"mode":"mono"}`
