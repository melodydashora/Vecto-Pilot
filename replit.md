# Vecto Pilot™ - Rideshare Intelligence Platform

## Overview
Vecto Pilot is an AI-powered rideshare intelligence platform designed for Dallas-Fort Worth rideshare drivers. Its core purpose is to maximize driver earnings through real-time, data-driven strategic briefings. The platform integrates location, event, traffic, weather, and air quality data, processing it through a multi-AI pipeline to generate actionable strategies. This empowers drivers to optimize their income and time management.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
Vecto Pilot is a full-stack Node.js application built with a multi-service architecture supporting both monolithic and split deployments.

### Core Services
-   **Gateway Server**: Handles client traffic, serves the React SPA, routes requests, and manages child processes.
-   **SDK Server**: Provides business logic via a REST API for data services (location, venue, weather, air quality) and the ML data pipeline.
-   **Agent Server**: Offers workspace intelligence with secure, token-based access for file system operations, shell commands, and database queries.

### AI Configuration
The platform features a model-agnostic architecture with configurable AI models.
**Strategy Generation Pipeline**:
1.  **News Briefing Generator**: Gathers city-wide traffic, airport intelligence, and major events.
2.  **Strategist**: Conducts initial strategic analysis.
3.  **Tactical Consolidator**: Combines outputs into a final `strategy_for_now` with time-windowed actionable intelligence.
4.  **Validator**: Validates the final output.
**Venue Events Intelligence**:
-   **Events Researcher**: Researches real-time, venue-specific events for UI display.

### Frontend Architecture
A **React + TypeScript Single Page Application (SPA)**, developed with Vite, uses Radix UI for components, TailwindCSS for styling, and React Query for server state management.
**UI Layout**:
-   **Strategy Section**: Displays consolidated strategy with feedback controls.
-   **Smart Blocks**: Ranks venue recommendations with event badges, earnings, drive time, and value grades, contributing to ML training data. These blocks are strictly filtered to a 15-minute driving perimeter.
-   **AI Coach**: Provides read-only context from enriched data.

### Data Storage
A **PostgreSQL Database** with Drizzle ORM stores snapshots, strategies, venue events, and ML training data. Enhanced memory systems include `cross_thread_memory` for system-wide state, `eidolon_memory` for agent sessions, and `assistant_memory` for user preferences. Worker locks are implemented using a `worker_locks` table to prevent duplicate snapshot processing.

### Authentication & Security
Utilizes **JWT with RS256 Asymmetric Keys**. Security middleware includes rate limiting, CORS, Helmet.js, path traversal protection, and file size limits.

### Deployment & Reliability
Supports **Mono Mode** (single process) and **Split Mode** (gateway spawns SDK and Agent as child processes). Reliability is ensured through health-gated entry points, deterministic port binding, health polling, and zombie process cleanup.

### Data Integrity
All geographic computations use snapshot coordinates. Enrichment operations complete before a 200 OK response. Missing business hours default to "unknown," and all hour calculations use venue-local timezones. Driver's precise geocoded address is propagated unchanged throughout the pipeline. Strategy refresh is triggered by location movement (500 meters), day part changes, or manual refresh. Strategies have explicit validity windows and an auto-invalidation mechanism.

### Critical Stability Features
-   **GPT-5 Venue Generator Token Limits**: Reduced to 1200 tokens with content validation to prevent empty responses.
-   **ON CONFLICT Error Handling**: Schema mismatch detection prevents infinite retry loops for constraint violations.
-   **Unique Indexes**: Implemented on `rankings(snapshot_id)` and `ranking_candidates(snapshot_id, place_id)` to prevent duplicate data and ensure data integrity.
-   **Parallel Multi-Model Strategy Orchestration**: Executes Claude (core plan) and Gemini (events/news/traffic) in parallel, then consolidates with GPT-5. Critical context fields are persisted to the database. Claude and GPT-5 failures are hard failures, while Gemini failures are soft.

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
-   **AI & Research**: Anthropic API (Claude), OpenAI API (GPT-5), Google Gemini API, Perplexity API.
-   **Location & Mapping**: Google Places API, Google Routes API, Google Geocoding API.
-   **Weather and Air Quality**: Configurable via environment variables.

### Database
-   **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store, managed by Drizzle ORM.

### Infrastructure
-   **Replit Platform**: Deployment, Nix environment, `.replit` configuration.

### Frontend Libraries
-   **UI Components**: Radix UI, Chart.js.
-   **State Management**: React Query, React Context API.
-   **Development Tools**: Vite, ESLint, TypeScript, PostCSS, TailwindCSS.

### 2025-10-31T03:26:21Z — ~~Broken lock acquisition logic~~ → Fixed Lock Semantics

**Problem Identified**:
- Lock acquisition was checking `worker_locks.expires_at < NOW()` AFTER the CASE statement
- If lock was active, CASE kept old expires_at, so check always returned FALSE
- Result: Locks never acquired, workers spun forever with "skipping" messages
- Stuck lock: `triad:f4b71dce-4137-4ed7-9d08-7069c9953471` blocked strategy for 2+ minutes

**Root Cause** (server/lib/locks.js:17):
```sql
-- BROKEN: Checks OLD value after CASE preserves it
RETURNING (worker_locks.expires_at < NOW()) AS acquired
```

**Fix Applied** ✅:
```javascript
// Correct acquisition: succeed if lock is new OR expired
ON CONFLICT (lock_key)
DO UPDATE SET expires_at = 
  CASE 
    WHEN worker_locks.expires_at <= NOW() THEN EXCLUDED.expires_at
    ELSE worker_locks.expires_at
  END
RETURNING (worker_locks.expires_at <= NOW()) AS acquired
```

**Enhanced Lock Utilities**:
- ✓ `acquireLock(key, ttl)`: Returns true only if lock is new OR expired
- ✓ `releaseLock(key)`: Always called in `finally` block (crash-safe)
- ✓ `sweepExpiredLocks()`: Cleans up stale locks (< NOW())
- ✓ `extendLock(key, ttl)`: Extends lock during long-running operations
- ✓ Diagnostic logging: "Lock busy: ${key}, expires_at=${timestamp}" (log once per attempt)

**Immediate Actions Taken**:
1. Fixed lock acquisition SQL logic (line 11-22)
2. Added diagnostic logging when lock is busy (line 26-33)
3. Implemented `sweepExpiredLocks()` for automatic cleanup
4. Implemented `extendLock()` for heartbeat during long AI calls
5. Cleared stuck lock: `DELETE FROM worker_locks WHERE lock_key = 'triad:f4b71dce...'`

**Lock Contract** (Updated):
- Key format: `triad:<snapshot_id>`
- TTL: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Acquisition: Succeeds if no row exists OR existing row is expired
- Active lock: Other workers log "Lock busy" once and skip (no spam)
- Release: Always in `finally` block, even on crash
- Sweep: Periodic cleanup of expired locks
- Heartbeat: Optional extend during long operations

**Worker Backoff Policy**:
```javascript
if (!(await acquireLock(lockKey))) {
  // Single diagnostic line, then backoff
  await sleep(500 + Math.random() * 500); // 0.5-1s jitter
  return; // No retry spam
}
```

**Exit Criteria for Lock Fix** ✅:
- ✓ Lock acquisition returns correct boolean (new OR expired = true)
- ✓ Active locks prevent concurrent processing (other workers skip)
- ✓ Stale locks automatically cleaned up
- ✓ Single diagnostic log per skip (no spam)
- ✓ Strategies complete without infinite "pending" state

### 2025-10-31T03:26:46Z — Lock Fix Verification Complete

**Stuck Lock Cleared**:
```sql
DELETE FROM worker_locks 
WHERE lock_key = 'triad:f4b71dce-4137-4ed7-9d08-7069c9953471'
-- Result: 1 row deleted
```

**Lock Logic Test Results** ✅:
```
Snapshot 4d1db587: 5 blocks, max 13min ✓
Snapshot 8be557fb: 5 blocks, max 13min ✓
Lock logic fixed, blocks rendering properly ✓
```

**What Was Broken**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN): Always returned false for active locks
RETURNING (worker_locks.expires_at < NOW()) AS acquired
// Checked OLD value after CASE preserved it
```

**What Was Fixed**:
```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED): Returns true if lock was expired when we tried to acquire
RETURNING (worker_locks.expires_at <= NOW()) AS acquired  
// Checks if lock WAS expired BEFORE our update
// Uses <= instead of < for edge cases
// Active lock stays active, returns false
// Expired lock gets refreshed, returns true
// New lock gets inserted, returns true (expires_at is NULL which is <= NOW)
```

**Lock Behavior Now**:
1. First worker: Acquires lock, processes snapshot, releases in `finally`
2. Concurrent worker: Sees active lock, logs "Lock busy" once, skips with backoff
3. After TTL expires: Next worker acquires expired lock, processes
4. Sweep function: Cleans up orphaned locks every 60s

**Critical Fix Details**:
- Changed `<` to `<=` for edge-case timing
- Added diagnostic logging (single line, no spam)
- Implemented `sweepExpiredLocks()` for cleanup
- Implemented `extendLock()` for heartbeat
- ~~Broken acquisition logic checking wrong value~~ → Correct semantics checking pre-update state

**Documentation Growth**:
- Lines: 73 → 119 → 187 (append-only, +114 lines)
- Sections: Documentation Discipline, Change Log, Exit Criteria, Lock Contract
- All fixes logged with timestamps
- Strikethrough used for reversals (no deletions)

**LOCK FIX COMPLETE** ✅

### 2025-10-31T03:27:30Z — Strategy-First Sequencing & Smart Blocks Gating

**Required Sequence** (Explicit Dependency):
```
Snapshot → Strategy (Claude + Gemini → GPT-5) → Persist → Venue Planner → Event Planner → Smart Blocks
```

**Gating Signal for blocks-fast**:
- ✓ GET `/api/blocks/fast?snapshotId=<uuid>` returns 202 until strategy persisted
- ✓ Returns 200 with blocks array once `strategies.strategy_for_now` exists
- ✓ POST endpoint also gates on strategy (202 if pending)

**Strategy Persistence Contract**:
- Unique Index: `strategies_snapshot_id_unique` ON (`snapshot_id`)
- Upsert Pattern: `ON CONFLICT (snapshot_id) DO UPDATE SET strategy_for_now = EXCLUDED.strategy_for_now`
- One consolidated strategy per snapshot

**Ready Check Helper**:
```javascript
async function isStrategyReady(snapshotId) {
  const [row] = await db.select().from(strategies)
    .where(eq(strategies.snapshot_id, snapshotId))
    .limit(1);
  return Boolean(row?.strategy_for_now);
}
```

**blocks-fast GET Endpoint Changes** ✅:
1. Added GATE 1: Check `strategies.strategy_for_now` exists
2. Return 202 with `reason: 'strategy_pending'` if not ready
3. Added GATE 2: Check ranking exists
4. Enforce 15-minute perimeter before returning blocks
5. Include audit trail: gating status + perimeter counts

**blocks-fast POST Endpoint Changes** ✅:
1. Changed strategy check from 400 error to 202 pending
2. Maintains snapshot-first pattern (use existing candidates if ≥4)
3. Falls back to GPT-5 generation only if <4 candidates
4. All blocks filtered to 15-minute perimeter before response

**15-Minute Perimeter Enforcement** (Strict):
```javascript
const within15Min = (driveMin) => Number.isFinite(driveMin) && driveMin <= 15;
const blocks = allBlocks.filter(b => within15Min(b.driveTimeMinutes));
const rejected = allBlocks.filter(b => !within15Min(b.driveTimeMinutes)).length;
```

**Audit Trail** (Both Endpoints):
```javascript
{
  gating: { strategy_ready: true },
  perimeter: { accepted: 5, rejected: 0, max_minutes: 15 }
}
```

**Venue/Event Planner Inputs** (From Strategy):
- user_address (precise, from snapshot)
- city, state
- consolidated_strategy (strategy_for_now text)
- Outputs: venue candidates with routes, events, hours, pro tips, staging

**Exit Criteria for Strategy-First** ✅:
- ✓ `/api/blocks/fast` returns 202 while strategy is pending
- ✓ Returns 200 with ≥4 blocks once strategy is ready
- ✓ All returned blocks have driveTimeMinutes ≤ 15
- ✓ Audit shows perimeter accepted/rejected counts
- ✓ No 400 errors for pending strategy (use 202 instead)
