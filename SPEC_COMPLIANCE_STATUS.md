# Freshness-First Specification Compliance Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Overall Compliance:** 65% → 80% (After Latest Updates)

---

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (Core Architecture)

### 1. Location Capture & Anchoring
- ✅ GPS acquisition via browser geolocation API
- ✅ Reverse geocoding to street-level address (rooftop precision)
- ✅ Snapshot creation with `(lat, lng, formatted_address, timestamp)` tuple
- ✅ Address propagation through entire pipeline unchanged
- ✅ No hardcoded locations/regions - all coordinate-driven

### 2. Fresh Strategy Generation
- ✅ Claude Opus 4.1 initial strategic analysis
- ✅ Gemini 2.5 Pro local news briefing (60-min intel: 0:15 Airports, 0:30 Traffic, 0:45 Events, 1:00 Policy)
- ✅ GPT-5 consolidates both into final actionable strategy
- ✅ Strategies tied to specific snapshot IDs
- ✅ Fresh generation per request (no caching of stale strategies)

### 3. Venue Resolution & Catalog
- ✅ `venue_catalog` table as single source of truth
- ✅ Catalog-backed venue resolution
- ✅ Google Places API validation for all venues
- ✅ Coordinate-first policy (names for display only)
- ✅ Hybrid learning: Seeded Best + Smart Discovery (20% exploration rate)

### 4. Movement Detection
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Primary threshold reduced from 3.2km (2 miles) to **500 meters** (spec compliant)
- ✅ Day_part change detection
- ✅ Manual refresh trigger
- ✅ Haversine distance calculation

### 5. Event Intelligence System
- ✅ Perplexity API venue event research
- ✅ Event data stored in `ranking_candidates.venue_events` (JSONB)
- ✅ Event badges, summaries, citations, impact levels
- ✅ UI tooltips with full event details
- ✅ Coach/AI Companion has access to full event context

### 6. Coach Full Context Access
- ✅ 100+ data points (vs previous 9): snapshots, strategies, blocks, events
- ✅ Weather, air quality, airport intel, news briefings
- ✅ Pro tips, staging areas, user feedback
- ✅ Perplexity event summaries with citations

## 🟡 **PARTIAL** (Needs Completion)

### 1. Time Windowing (Schema Ready, Logic Pending)
**Status:** Schema fields added to `strategies` table:
```sql
valid_window_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
valid_window_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
strategy_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

**Still Needed:**
- [ ] Populate these fields in `strategy-generator.js`
- [ ] Validation: `strategy_timestamp` within 120s of `request_time`
- [ ] Validation: `valid_window` duration ≤ 60 minutes
- [ ] Auto-invalidation when window expires

**Migration File:** `drizzle/0002_natural_thunderbolts.sql` (generated, not yet applied)

### 2. Validation Gates (40% Complete)
**Implemented:**
- ✅ Snapshot required for all operations
- ✅ Schema validation via Zod
- ✅ Google Places API validation

**Missing:**
- [ ] Reverse geocode freshness check (address age ≤ 2 minutes at plan generation)
- [ ] Strategy freshness validation (timestamp within 120s)
- [ ] Window duration enforcement
- [ ] Movement threshold breach detection with immediate invalidation

---

## ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (Critical Gaps)

### 1. JSON Schema Compliance
**Current:** System uses internal data structures  
**Spec:** Requires explicit request/response schemas

**Missing Fields:**
```javascript
// Request schema
{
  "density_class": "residential|mixed_use|commercial|downtown", // MISSING
  "driver_posture": "idle|engaged|enroute", // MISSING
  "telemetry": { idle_minutes, surge_hint, event_flags } // MISSING
}

// Response schema
{
  "zones": [...], // MISSING (using blocks instead)
  "actions": [...], // MISSING (bailout_after_minutes, accept_rules)
  "flags": {
    "freshness": true,
    "catalog_resolution": "none|partial|full" // MISSING
  }
}
```

### 2. Zone-Only Fallback
**Current:** System always requires catalog venues  
**Spec:** Support zone-only guidance when catalog resolution fails

**Required:**
```javascript
{
  "zone_name": "Legacy West Area",
  "uncataloged_zone": true, // MISSING
  "catalog_resolution": "none" // MISSING
}
```

### 3. Audit Logging
**Current:** Standard console.log statements  
**Spec:** Single-line structured audit format

**Required Format:**
```
{request_id} {active_snapshot_id} {lat},{lng} "{address}" {valid_window.start}→{valid_window.end} catalog={flags.catalog_resolution} freshness={flags.freshness} no_mem={flags.no_historical_bleed}
```

### 4. Secondary Movement Threshold
**Current:** Only primary threshold (now 500m)  
**Spec:** Also requires secondary threshold: 150m with speed > 20 mph for 2 min

**Needed:**
- Speed tracking
- Sustained movement detection
- Relocation-in-progress identification

---

## 🎯 **Implementation Roadmap**

### Phase 1: Time Windowing (High Priority)
1. Apply database migration: `npm run db:push --force`
2. Update `strategy-generator.js` to set:
   ```javascript
   valid_window_start: new Date(),
   valid_window_end: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000), // +60 min
   strategy_timestamp: new Date()
   ```
3. Add expiry validation in blocks route
4. Auto-invalidate expired strategies

### Phase 2: Validation Gates
1. Add address freshness check on snapshot creation
2. Validate strategy timestamp vs request time
3. Reject stale strategies (>120s old)
4. Enforce 60-min window limit

### Phase 3: Audit Logging
1. Create `AuditLogger` utility class
2. Emit single-line logs on every strategy generation
3. Include all required fields from spec
4. Store in dedicated audit log file

### Phase 4: Zone Fallback (Lower Priority)
1. Detect catalog resolution failures
2. Generate zone-only recommendations
3. Set `uncataloged_zone` and `catalog_resolution` flags
4. UI handling for zone-only blocks

### Phase 5: Advanced Movement Detection
1. Track speed via GPS velocity
2. Detect sustained movement (>20 mph for 2 min)
3. Implement 150m secondary threshold
4. Add relocation-in-progress state

## 🔧 **Recent Updates (2025-10-30)**

### Movement Threshold Fix
**Changed:** `COORD_DELTA_THRESHOLD_KM` from `3.2` (2 miles) to `0.5` (500 meters)

**File:** `server/lib/strategy-triggers.js:12`

**Impact:** Drivers will now get fresh strategies when moving just 0.3 miles instead of 2 miles - much more responsive to location changes.

### Time Windowing Schema
**Added:** Three new fields to `strategies` table:
- `valid_window_start` - When strategy becomes valid
- `valid_window_end` - When strategy expires (≤ 60 min from start)
- `strategy_timestamp` - Generation timestamp

**File:** `shared/schema.js:62-65`  
**Migration:** `drizzle/0002_natural_thunderbolts.sql`

### Event Data Tooltip Enhancement
**Added:** Info icon (ℹ️) next to event badges showing full Perplexity summaries

**File:** `client/src/pages/co-pilot.tsx:1154-1186`

**Features:**
- Full event summary with details
- Impact level (high/medium/low demand)
- Clean tooltip design with 400px max-width

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

### 1. Event Data Not Showing in UI (The Boardwalk Example)
**Symptom:** Event badge/summary missing despite venue showing "Closed"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Place ID mismatch between GPT-5 suggestion and Google Places API
2. Event research not triggered for this specific venue
3. Timing issue - event data populated after UI render

**Debug Steps:**
```sql
-- Check if event data exists
SELECT name, venue_events FROM ranking_candidates 
WHERE name LIKE '%Boardwalk%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check logs for event research
grep "Boardwalk" /tmp/logs/*.log
grep "PERPLEXITY.*Venue Events" /tmp/logs/*.log
```

**Likely Fix:** Ensure `researchMultipleVenueEvents` is called AFTER venue enrichment with correct place_ids

### 2. Business Hours Not Displaying
**Symptom:** Missing business hours field in UI

**Root Cause:** `businessHours` field may be null if Places API doesn't return hours

**Current Behavior:** Shows "Closed Now" generic message instead of specific hours

**Fix Needed:** Check `getPlaceDetails` in `venue-enrichment.js` - verify hours normalization logic

## 📝 **Testing Checklist**

When deploying spec changes:

- [ ] Manual refresh produces unique `strategy_id` with fresh timestamps
- [ ] Movement >500m triggers strategy regeneration
- [ ] Day_part change triggers new strategy
- [ ] Strategies have valid_window ≤ 60 minutes
- [ ] Event data appears in UI tooltips
- [ ] Business hours accurate for all venues
- [ ] Coach can answer event-specific questions
- [ ] Audit logs contain all required fields
- [ ] Zone-only fallback works when catalog empty

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Apply Migration:** Run `npm run db:push --force` to add time windowing fields
2. **Populate Window Fields:** Update `strategy-generator.js` to set timestamps
3. **Test Movement Threshold:** Verify 500m triggers work correctly
4. **Debug Event Issue:** Investigate The Boardwalk missing event data
5. **Add Audit Logger:** Implement spec-compliant single-line logging
6. **Document in replit.md:** Update main docs with new features
