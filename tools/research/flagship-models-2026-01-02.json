I need to be honest that the search results don't contain this level of technical detail.\n\n\nI can share what the search results reveal about model releases and capabilities, but I'll need to be transparent about the gaps. The results confirm o3-mini's reasoning effort options and that GPT-5 models emerged in late 2025, but they lack the precise API documentation, pricing tiers, and parameter specifications the user needs.

I can share what's available, though the results lack comprehensive endpoint specifications, pricing structures, and quota limits for most of the APIs you've requested.\n\n## Available Information from Search Results\n\n**Google Roads API** is specifically mentioned for rideshare use cases[1]. This API includes three components:\n\n- **Snap to Roads endpoint:** `GET https://roads.googleapis.com/v1/snapToRoads?path={latitude,longitude}&key={YOUR_API_KEY}`\n- **Nearest Roads endpoint:** Accepts up to 100 individual GPS coordinates and returns the closest road segment[1]\n- **Speed Limits endpoint:** `GET https://roads.googleapis.com/v1/speedLimits?placeId={PLACE_ID}&key={YOUR_API_KEY}`\n\nThe Speed Limits endpoint requires a **Google Asset Tracking license** and accepts up to 100 place IDs per request, with `{PLACE_ID}` obtained from the Google Place Details API[1].\n\n## External API Services Mentioned\n\nThe search results reference that rideshare platforms use **Google Maps Platform or Mapbox** for location, navigation, and geocoding services[3], with recurring usage fees estimated between $100 to $5,000/month depending on scale[6].\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe search results do not provide:\n- Detailed endpoints and parameters for Places API (new vs. legacy), Routes API, or Geocoding API\n- Specific pricing per 1,000 requests\n- Daily quota limits\n- Information on Weather or Air Quality APIs\n- Places API new vs. legacy migration requirements\n\nFor current, comprehensive documentation on these APIs' endpoints, parameters, pricing tiers, and quota structures as of January 2026, you would need to consult Google's official Maps Platform documentation directly, as the available search results focus primarily on the Roads API and general cost considerations rather than detailed API specifications.",

    "answer": "<think>\nThe user is asking for very specific technical details about API parameters, breaking changes, and error-causing configurations for several flagship AI models as of January 2, 2026.\n\nHowever, looking at the search results provided, they contain:\n1. TechRadar article about AI predictions for 2026\n2. Foundation Capital article about where AI is headed in 2026\n\nThese search results are about high-level predictions and trends for 2026 - they discuss things like ChatGPT becoming a digital butler, Google Search becoming AI-first, and AI content trends. They do NOT contain any technical API documentation, parameter specifications, breaking changes, or specific error configurations.\n\nThe user is asking for:\n- OpenAI GPT-5/o-series parameter details (max_completion_tokens vs max_tokens, reasoning_effort values, temperature support, developer vs system role)\n- Anthropic Claude 4.5 parameters (thinking parameters, headers, web search)\n- Google Gemini 3.0 parameters (thinkingConfig format, thinking_budget status, search grounding)\n- Perplexity Sonar parameters (search_context_size, search_recency_filter)\n\nNone of this technical information is in the provided search results. The search results are strategic/trend-focused, not technical API documentation.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n- \"If the search results are missing information or insufficient to fully answer the user query, supplement your response with your own knowledge only when confident. Clearly indicate and justify any inferences or speculation that go beyond what is explicitly stated in the search results.\"\n- I should not make up API parameters or specific breaking changes I'm not confident about\n- I should acknowledge limitations transparently when search results are incomplete\n\nI should be honest that the search results do not contain the technical API parameter information requested.\n</think>\n\nThe search results provided do not contain technical API documentation, parameter specifications, or breaking change information for these AI models. The sources focus on high-level predictions about AI trends in 2026 (such as ChatGPT's evolution into a household assistant and Gemini's market growth) rather than developer-facing API constraints.\n\nTo accurately answer your query about critical parameter constraints and 400/401 error configurations, you would need:\n\n- Official API documentation from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Perplexity\n- Release notes and changelog entries for these specific models\n- Developer forums or status pages documenting known breaking changes\n\nI cannot reliably provide the specific parameter validation rules, valid enum values, or error-causing misconfigurations you've requested without access to current technical documentation, as API specifications change frequently and incorrect information could cause production issues.\n\nI recommend consulting:\n- OpenAI's official API reference for GPT and o-series model parameters\n- Anthropic's documentation for Claude model specifications\n- Google's Gemini API documentation\n- Perplexity's developer portal for Sonar configuration\n\nThese official sources will have authoritative information about which parameters each model supports, exact valid values, and which configurations trigger authentication or validation errors.",

    "answer": "<think>\nThe user is asking for code examples for the latest AI model APIs as of January 2, 2026. They want specific code examples for:\n\n1. OpenAI GPT-5.2\n2. Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5\n3. Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview\n4. Perplexity Sonar Pro\n\nHowever, looking at my search results, I only have information about OpenAI's GPT-5.2.
