The search results provided focus on Perplexity AI's general capabilities (calendar integration, web search functionality, and task scheduling) rather than detailed API parameters for hyperlocal event discovery.\n\nTo get accurate, current information about these APIs, I recommend:\n\n**For Perplexity AI API**: Check the official Perplexity API documentation at perplexity.mintlify.app for current `web_search_options` parameters. The search results mention a `user_location` parameter for geographic filtering[2], but specific event discovery endpoints and recency filter values aren't detailed in the available information.\n\n**For SerpAPI**: Visit their official documentation to verify whether `engine=google_events` exists and what parameters it supports. The search results don't contain SerpAPI-specific information.\n\n**For NewsAPI**: Their official documentation would have current location filtering capabilities and parameter specifications.\n\n**For Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Google's API documentation would provide the latest parameters for data extraction and geocoding.\n\nSince these are rapidly evolving APIs and you need precise parameter names, exact endpoint URLs, and valid value ranges as of December 2025, I strongly recommend consulting each provider's official API documentation directly rather than relying on potentially outdated information. API specifications change frequently, and official documentation will have the most current and accurate details for your hyperlocal event discovery use case.",

    "answer": "## OpenAI GPT-5 Parameters\n\n**GPT-5 does not support temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, or presence_penalty.**[2] These parameters are explicitly unsupported with reasoning models in the GPT-5 series.\n\nInstead, GPT-5 uses the **reasoning_effort** parameter to control model behavior. This parameter replaces the traditional sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty) that governed output randomness and diversity in earlier models.\n\nThe valid values for **reasoning_effort** are:[2]\n- minimal\n- low\n- medium\n- high\n\nAdditionally, GPT-5 does not support **max_tokens**, **logprobs**, **top_logprobs**, **logit_bias**, or the **apply_patch** and **shell** tools.[2] Support for the apply_patch and shell tools with GPT-5.1 series models is coming soon.\n\nFor output control, GPT-5 models (GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, and GPT-5 Nano) support a **Verbosity** setting that can be configured to Low (default), Medium, or High, which determines how many output tokens the model generates for each request.[3]\n\n## Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 Parameters\n\nThe search results do not contain specific information about which API parameters Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports. However, the model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.5 is **claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929**. To obtain accurate parameter information for this model, you would need to consult Anthropic's official API documentation.\n\n## Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Parameters\n\nThe search results do not contain detailed information about Gemini 2.5 Pro's supported parameters. Based on the personalization context, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports standard **temperature** and **max_tokens** parameters, but the search results provided do not include the specific valid ranges or a complete parameter list for this model.\n\n## Breaking Changes from GPT-4 to GPT-5\n\nThe most significant breaking change is the removal of traditional sampling parameters. GPT-4 supported temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty, but GPT-5 does not support any of these parameters.[2] Applications migrating from GPT-4 to GPT-5 must remove these parameters from their API calls and instead use the reasoning_effort parameter to control model behavior.",

    "answer": "# Deprecated AI Models: Late 2024 and Early 2025\n\n## OpenAI Model Deprecations\n\nOpenAI has conducted several significant model retirements during this period, with confirmed deprecations from their official API documentation.\n\n**GPT-4 and GPT-4 Variants**\n\nThe original GPT-4 model was phased out by April 2025[3], replaced by the more capable GPT-4o released in May 2024. Additionally, `gpt-4-32k` and `gpt-4-vision-preview` were deprecated, with `gpt-4-vision-preview` having a six-month sunset window from June 2024[2].\n\n**GPT-4.5-preview**\n\n`gpt-4.5-preview` was deprecated on April 14, 2025, with a shutdown date of July 14, 2025[2][4]. The recommended replacement is `gpt-4.1`[4].\n\n**Reasoning Models (o1 Series)**\n\nTwo reasoning models reached end-of-life in mid-2025:\n- `o1-preview` was deprecated on April 28, 2025, with shutdown on July 28, 2025[2][4]. The replacement is `o3`[2][4].\n- `o1-mini` was deprecated on April 28, 2025, with shutdown on October 27, 2025[2]. The replacement is `o4-mini`[2].\n\n**Realtime API Preview**\n\n`gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01` was deprecated on June 10, 2025, with removal on September 10, 2025[2]. Developers should migrate to `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`[2].\n\n**GPT-4o API Deprecation (Upcoming)**\n\nMost significantly, `chatgpt-4o-latest` will be retired from the API in mid-February 2026[1]. OpenAI is encouraging developers to adopt `gpt-5.1` for new workloads, with `gpt-5.1-chat-latest` serving as the general-purpose chat endpoint[1]. The `gpt-4o-mini` variant remains available at a budget tier[1].\n\n**Fine-tuning Deprecations**\n\nNew fine-tuning training on `babbage-002` and `davinci-002` was discontinued on October 28, 2024[2]. The recommended replacement for fine-tuning is `gpt-4o-mini`[2].\n\n**DALL-E 3 Deprecation**\n\nDALL-E 3 model snapshots are scheduled for deprecation on May 2, 2026[7].\n\n## Information Gaps\n\nThe search results do not contain confirmed deprecation information for Anthropic Claude models or Google AI models during this period. Only OpenAI deprecations from official sources are included in this response.",
