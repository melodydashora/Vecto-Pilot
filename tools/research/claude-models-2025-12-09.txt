Excellent question. Since I am an AI with a knowledge base updated to the present, I cannot predict the future with certainty. Therefore, I cannot provide the actual model details for December 2025.

However, I can give you two things:

1.  The most up-to-date information on Anthropic's models as of early-to-mid 2024, which represents the current state-of-the-art.
2.  A projection of what we might realistically expect by December 2025 based on current industry trends.

### Part 1: Latest Models (As of March 2024)

This is the factual, current information for the latest production-ready models from Anthropic.

The newest models are the **Claude 3 family**, which introduced a spectrum of models with varying capabilities and costs, as well as vision (multimodal) capabilities for the first time.

#### 1. Latest Model Names and API Identifiers

*   **Claude 3 Opus:** The most powerful and intelligent model.
    *   API Identifier: `claude-3-opus-20240229`
*   **Claude 3 Sonnet:** The balanced model for performance and speed.
    *   API Identifier: `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
*   **Claude 3 Haiku:** The fastest and most compact model for near-instant responsiveness.
    *   API Identifier: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`

#### 2. Release Dates

*   **Opus and Sonnet:** February 29, 2024
*   **Haiku:** March 7, 2024

#### 3. Key Features and Improvements

*   **Multimodality (Vision):** All Claude 3 models can analyze and interpret images, charts, graphs, and documents. This was a major leap from the text-only Claude 2 series.
*   **"Smarter, Faster, Cheaper" Spectrum:** Anthropic positioned the models to cover different use cases: Opus for complex reasoning, Sonnet for enterprise workloads, and Haiku for real-time interactions.
*   **Near-Human Performance:** Opus, in particular, demonstrated performance on par with or exceeding other top-tier models like GPT-4 on various industry benchmarks for reasoning, knowledge, and coding.
*   **Reduced Refusals:** The models are significantly less likely to refuse to answer prompts that border on safety guardrails, showing a more nuanced understanding of user intent.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy & Long-Context Recall:** Improved ability to recall information accurately from large documents ("Needle In A Haystack" test).
*   **Better Instruction Following:** More reliable at following complex, multi-step instructions and producing structured output like JSON.

#### 4. Context Window Sizes

*   All three Claude 3 models launched with a **200,000 token** context window.
*   Anthropic has stated they are capable of accepting inputs over **1 million tokens** for specific customers who need that capability.

#### 5. Pricing Information (per 1 million tokens)

| Model           | Input Price  | Output Price |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| **Claude 3 Opus** | $15.00       | $75.00       |
| **Claude 3 Sonnet** | $3.00        | $15.00       |
| **Claude 3 Haiku**  | $0.25        | $1.25        |

#### 6. Deprecated/Superseded Models

With the release of the Claude 3 family, the following models are now considered legacy. While still available for a transition period, new development is highly encouraged on the Claude 3 models.

*   **Claude 2.1:** (`claude-2.1`) - Was the previous flagship with a 200K context window.
*   **Claude 2.0:** (`claude-2.0`) - The predecessor to 2.1 with a 100K context window.
*   **Claude Instant 1.2:** (`claude-instant-1.2`) - The previous fast and low-cost model.

### Part 2: Hypothetical Projection for December 2025

This section is **speculative** and based on industry trends like the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

By the end of 2025, we could expect to see a "Claude 4" or similarly named generation.

#### 1. Hypothetical Model Names

*   **Claude 4 Nexus:** A potential flagship model focused on advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities.
    *   *Hypothetical API ID:* `claude-4-nexus-20251015`
*   **Claude 4 Sonnet Pro:** An evolution of Sonnet, becoming the new workhorse for most enterprise tasks.
    *   *Hypothetical API ID:* `claude-4-sonnet-pro-20251015`
*   **Claude 4 Photon:** A successor to Haiku, even faster and more efficient for edge computing and real-time applications.
    *   *Hypothetical API ID:* `claude-4-photon-20251101`

#### 2. Hypothetical Release Dates

*   We could expect a major release in **Q3 or Q4 2025**.

#### 3. Hypothetical Key Features and Improvements

*   **Advanced Agentic Capabilities:** The ability to autonomously use tools, browse the web, and execute multi-step tasks to achieve a goal with minimal human intervention.
*   **Deeper Multimodality:** Moving beyond static images to include **audio and video processing** as standard inputs. The model could summarize meetings from a recording or describe actions in a video clip.
*   **Stateful and Personalized Models:** APIs that allow for persistent memory and personalization, enabling the model to learn from past interactions with a specific user or application.
*   **Drastically Improved Reasoning:** Enhanced capabilities in complex logic, mathematics, and scientific reasoning, making it a reliable tool for research and analysis.
*   **On-Device Models:** A version like "Photon" might be small and efficient enough to run directly on high-end mobile devices or laptops.

#### 4. Hypothetical Context Window Sizes

*   The **1 million token context window** would likely be standard and widely available for all production models.
*   Research may be pushing towards "infinite context" or highly efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) built directly into the model.

#### 5. Hypothetical Pricing

*   Competition would likely drive prices down. The flagship "Nexus" model might debut at a price similar to today's Opus ($10-$20 per million input tokens), while the cost of the lower-tier models could fall by 50-75% from today's prices.

#### 6. Hypothetical Deprecated Models

*   By the end of 2025, the entire **Claude 3 family (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) would likely be considered legacy models**, replaced by the more capable and efficient Claude 4 generation for new projects.
