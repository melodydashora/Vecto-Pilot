Let me analyze what the search results provide:\n\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. GPT-5.2 was launched on December 11, 2025\n2. There are three variants:\n   - GPT-5.2 Instant (gpt-5.2-chat-latest)\n   - GPT-5.2 Thinking (gpt-5.2)\n   - GPT-5.2 Pro (gpt-5.2-pro)\n\n3. The search results mention pricing is \"substantially lower than OpenAI's most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which costs $150/$600 per million input/output tokens\"\n\nHowever, the search results do NOT provide:\n- Context window size\n- Max output tokens\n- Exact pricing for GPT-5.2 models\n- Parameters like max_completion_tokens, reasoning_effort values\n- Information about \"developer\" role vs \"system\" role\n- Details about other o-series models currently available\n\nThe search results are incomplete for the very specific technical information the user is asking for. According to my instructions, if the search results are empty or unhelpful for specific details, I should answer to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge, but I should be honest about what information is not available in the search results.\n\nSince the user is asking for very specific API parameters and the search results don't contain this level of detail, I should cite what IS available from the search results and clearly state what information is not available.\n\nThe user also asked me not to use phrases like \"According to the search results\" - so I need to naturally incorporate what I found without those phrases.\n\nGiven that this is a technical query asking for very specific API documentation details, and the search results don't contain comprehensive API specifications, I should be honest about the limitations while providing what is available.\n</think>\n\n## Latest OpenAI Flagship Models (December 2025)\n\nOpenAI's newest flagship models available via API are part of the GPT-5.2 family, launched December 11, 2025.[1]\n\n**GPT-5.2 Variants**\n\nThe following model IDs are available through the OpenAI API:[1]\n\n- **gpt-5.2** — The standard GPT-5.2 Thinking variant for complex reasoning tasks\n- **gpt-5.2-chat-latest** — GPT-5.2 Instant variant for routine queries requiring speed\n- **gpt-5.2-pro** — Premium tier for maximum accuracy and reliability on demanding problems\n\n## Available Technical Details\n\n**What the search results confirm:**\n\n- GPT-5.2 excels at extended context understanding and multi-step complex tasks[1]\n- The model demonstrates 38% fewer errors compared to GPT-5.1[1]\n- Pricing for GPT-5.2 variants is substantially lower than o1-pro, which costs $150/$600 per million input/output tokens[1]\n\n## Information Not Available\n\nThe search results do not contain the specific technical specifications you requested:\n\n- **Context window size** — not specified\n- **Max output tokens** — not specified\n- **Exact pricing per 1M tokens** for GPT-5.2 variants — not provided (only comparison to o1-pro mentioned)\n- **API parameters** (max_completion_tokens, reasoning_effort values) — not documented\n- **\"Developer\" vs \"system\" role** behavior — not addressed\n- **Other o-series models** currently available — not listed\n\nFor comprehensive API documentation with exact parameters, pricing tables, and endpoint specifications, you would need to consult OpenAI's official API documentation directly, as these search results focus on product announcements rather than detailed technical specifications.",

    "answer": "<think>\nThe user is asking for very specific, technical API parameter constraints and breaking changes for multiple AI models as of December 13, 2025. They want to know about:\n\n1. OpenAI GPT-5 / o-series models\n2. Anthropic Claude 4.5\n3. Google Gemini 3.0\n4. Perplexity Sonar\n\nThey're specifically asking for parameters that cause 400/401 errors, deprecations, and breaking changes.\n\nLooking at the search results provided:\n- Results 1-3 discuss the launch of GPT-5.2 with its three variants: Instant, Thinking, and Pro\n- Result 4 is the System Card PDF for GPT-5.2 (limited preview)\n- Result 5 is ChatGPT Release Notes mentioning knowledge cutoff date and ability to interrupt queries\n\nHowever, the search results do NOT contain:\n- Specific API parameter names for GPT-5.2\n- Exact valid values for parameters like reasoning_effort or temperature\n- Information about the \"developer\" role vs \"system\" role\n- Anthropic Claude 4.5 parameter details\n- Google Gemini 3.0 parameter specifics\n- Perplexity Sonar API parameters\n\nThe search results are about the release announcement of GPT-5.2, not about the technical API specifications and breaking changes the user is asking about.\n\nAccording to the restrictions and guidelines:\n- If search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available\n- I should not make up information\n- I should not speculate about API parameters not mentioned in the search results\n\nI need to be honest that the search results don't contain the specific API parameter information requested.\n</think>\n\nThe specific API parameter constraints and breaking changes you're requesting are not available in the provided search results. The search results focus on the feature announcements and benchmark performance of GPT-5.2, but do not include detailed API documentation covering:\n\n- Exact valid parameter values (reasoning_effort, temperature ranges)\n- max_completion_tokens vs max_tokens usage by specific model variants\n- Message role specifications (\"developer\" vs \"system\")\n- Anthropic's extended thinking and beta header requirements\n- Google Gemini 3.0's thinkingConfig format specifications\n- Perplexity Sonar search parameters and pricing impact\n\nWhat the search results do confirm about GPT-5.2 is that it's available in three variants—Instant, Thinking, and Pro—with a knowledge cutoff of August 2025[5], but the technical API specifications required to answer your question about breaking changes and parameter constraints are not documented in these materials.\n\nTo obtain accurate, production-grade API parameter documentation with error codes and breaking changes, you would need to reference the official API documentation for each provider (OpenAI API documentation, Anthropic's API reference, Google's Gemini API docs, and Perplexity's API guides) directly, as these specifications are not included in the available search results.",

    "answer": "<think>\nThe user is asking for code examples for the latest AI model APIs as of December 13, 2025. They want specific examples for:\n\n1. OpenAI GPT-5.2\n2. Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5\n3. Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview\n4. Perplexity Sonar Pro\n\nHowever, I need to look at what the search results actually provide. The search results only contain information about OpenAI GPT-5.2. There is no information about:\n- Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 (the search results don't mention this)\n- Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview (only mentioned briefly in one search result, no API details)\n- Perplexity Sonar Pro (not in search results)\n\nI should be honest about what information is available and what isn't. I can provide detailed code examples for GPT-5.2 based on the search results, but I cannot provide working code examples for the other models since the search results don't contain that information.\n\nLet me focus on what I know:\n- GPT-5.2 is the latest OpenAI model (announced December 11, 2025)\n- It has reasoning modes (thinking vs instant)\n- API models include: gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-chat-latest, gpt-5.2-pro\n- Context window: 400,000 tokens\n- Max output: 128,000 tokens (or 16,384 for chat-latest)\n- There's a `/responses/compact` endpoint for long-running workflows\n- Pricing: $1.75/million input, $14/million output (or higher for Pro)\n\nHowever, the search results don't provide:\n- Exact API parameter names for reasoning_effort\n- The exact format for the API calls\n- Node.js or Python SDK examples\n- Details on the other models requested\n\nI should be honest that I can only provide details for GPT-5.2, and I should indicate that the search results don't contain information about the other models.\n</think>\n\nI can only provide detailed code examples for **OpenAI GPT-5.2** based on the available search results, as they do not contain production API documentation or code examples for Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5, Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview, or Perplexity Sonar Pro.\n\n## OpenAI GPT-5.2\n\nBased on the search results, GPT-5.2 was announced on December 11, 2025[2]. The available API model identifiers are `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-chat-latest`, and `gpt-5.2-pro`[2]. The model supports a 400,000 token context window with 128,000 max output tokens[2]. However, the search results do not provide complete API parameter documentation for reasoning_effort, max_completion_tokens, or full SDK examples.\n\n**What I can tell you from the search results:**\n\nThe search results mention that GPT-5.2 is available in \"instant\" and \"thinking\" modes, presumably corresponding to different reasoning effort levels in the API[2]. There's also a `/responses/compact` endpoint for long-running, tool-heavy workflows that handles response compaction[2].\n\n**Limitation:** The search results provided do not contain the actual API parameter names, endpoint specifications, or working code examples with error handling for any of the four models you requested. To provide production-ready code examples with exact parameter names and current specifications, I would need access to:\n\n- OpenAI's official GPT-5.2 API reference documentation\n- Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 API documentation  \n- Google's Gemini 3 Pro Preview API documentation\n- Perplexity's Sonar Pro API documentation\n\nI recommend consulting the official API documentation for each provider, as the search results don't contain sufficient detail to generate accurate, production-ready code examples with all required headers, parameters, and error handling.",
