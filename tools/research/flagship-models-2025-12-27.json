Available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Free, and Enterprise users via API with the identifier `gpt-5.2`[2]. Also includes a \"Thinking\" variant for deeper reasoning work[1].\n\n**GPT-5.2-Codex** – Released December 18, 2025[1][2]\nThe most advanced agentic coding model with native context compaction, improved large refactors and migrations, enhanced Windows performance, and stronger cybersecurity capabilities. Available to paid Codex users; API access was planned to roll out in the weeks following release[1].\n\n**GPT Image 1.5** – Released December 17, 2025[4]\nDelivers 4× faster image generation with 20% reduced API costs compared to its predecessor[4].\n\n## O-Series Reasoning Models\n\nThe search results mention **o3 and o4-mini** are available in ChatGPT's model picker[3], but provide no additional details about availability, specifications, or release dates.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe search results do not include: context window sizes, max output tokens, exact API pricing per token, `max_completion_tokens` parameter values, `reasoning_effort` options, or clarification on \"developer\" vs \"system\" roles. For these specifications, you would need to consult OpenAI's official API documentation directly.",

The search results only provide general information about rideshare app development and that Google Maps is used for navigation and routing.\n\nI should explain that the search results don't contain the detailed technical specifications they're looking for, and I cannot reliably provide specific API endpoints, current pricing (as of Dec 2025), or quota limits without verified sources, as these details change frequently and accuracy is critical for developers.\n</think>\n\nThe search results provided do not contain the specific technical specifications you've requested for Google Maps Platform APIs. The search results discuss rideshare app development and mention that services like Google Maps are integrated for navigation and routing[1][2][5], but they do not include API endpoint URLs, authentication parameters, pricing details, daily quotas, or information about the Places API new vs. legacy versions.\n\nTo obtain the accurate, production-ready API specifications you need for rideshare development as of December 2025, I recommend consulting:\n\n- **Google Maps Platform official documentation** - The authoritative source for current API endpoints, parameter names, authentication methods, and pricing models\n- **Google Cloud Console** - For real-time quota limits and usage tracking specific to your project\n- **API Release Notes** - For any 2025 updates to Places API, Routes API, Geocoding API, and other services\n\nThis approach is essential because:\n\n- API endpoints and parameter specifications can change with platform updates\n- Pricing models and quota limits are subject to change and vary by account tier\n- The distinction between legacy and new Places API versions requires current documentation to avoid deprecated implementations\n- Accurate pricing information is critical for project budgeting\n\nIf you have access to Google Cloud documentation or specific API details from your development environment, I'd be happy to help interpret them or answer questions about how these APIs integrate into rideshare architectures based on that information.",

    "answer": "<think>\nThe user is asking me to provide working code examples for the latest AI model APIs as of December 27, 2025. They want specific examples for:\n1. OpenAI GPT-5.2\n2. Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5\n3. Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview\n4. Perplexity Sonar Pro\n\nHowever, I need to look at what the search results actually tell me. Let me review:\n\nFrom the search results:\n- GPT-5.2-Codex was released December 18, 2025 (results [1], [2])\n- GPT-5.2 was released in December 2025 (result [3], [4])\n- The results mention API access is coming soon for GPT-5.2-Codex but is available for GPT-5.2\n- I see references to API parameters in [3] mentioning \"Reasoning Effort\" and context frameworks\n- I don't see any specific API endpoint information, exact parameter names, or working code examples in these results\n- I don't see information about Claude Opus 4.5 API details\n- I don't see information about Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview\n- I don't see information about Perplexity Sonar Pro\n\nThe search results are insufficient to provide the specific, production-ready code examples the user is requesting. The results mention:\n- GPT-5.2 exists and was released December 2025\n- It supports reasoning_effort parameter (mentioned in [3])\n- API access for GPT-5.2-Codex is coming soon\n- But no actual API endpoints, exact parameter names, authentication details, or working code samples\n\nAccording to my instructions: \"If the search results are missing information or insufficient to fully answer the user query, supplement your response with your own knowledge only when confident. Clearly indicate and justify any inferences or speculation that go beyond what is explicitly stated in the search results.\"\n\nHowever, I should be honest about what the search results do and don't contain. The user is asking for very specific technical details that aren't present in these search results. I should tell them this clearly rather than making up API details that might be incorrect.\n\n\nI need to be careful not to invent code or API specifications that could lead them astray, especially for production implementations where accuracy matters.\n</think>\n\nI cannot provide the comprehensive production-ready code examples you've requested based on the available search results. The search results contain insufficient technical detail for the API implementations you need.\n\n**What the search results confirm:**\n\nGPT-5.2 was released in December 2025[4] with a specialized **GPT-5.2-Codex** variant optimized for agentic coding, released December 18[1][2]. The results mention that GPT-5.2 supports **reasoning_effort** parameters and use of a **CTCO Framework** (Context → Task → Constraints → Output) for prompting[3], but do not provide:\n\n- Specific API endpoint URLs\n- Exact authentication header formats\n- Complete parameter specifications and their valid values\n- Working code examples with error handling\n- SDK initialization syntax for production use\n\n**Critical gaps in the search results:**\n\nThe results provide no information about Claude Opus 4.5 API specifications, Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview details, or Perplexity Sonar Pro endpoints. While the search results mention GPT-5.2-Codex API access is \"coming soon\"[1][5], they don't provide the actual API interface details needed for functional code examples.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo obtain production-ready code examples with accurate parameter names, endpoints, and authentication requirements, you should consult:\n\n- The official OpenAI API documentation for GPT-5.2's current status and endpoint details\n- Current SDK documentation for each provider\n- The latest developer release notes for December 2025\n\nThis ensures your code uses the correct, current API specifications rather than potentially outdated information.",
